description: Understanding signal tasks for inter-workflow communication and event-driven coordination in Compozy workflows

# Overview

Signal tasks are the **event broadcasters** of Compozy's event-driven architecture. They enable workflows to send structured messages that coordinate between processes, trigger asynchronous actions, and implement sophisticated publish-subscribe patterns. When combined with [wait tasks](/docs/core/tasks/wait-tasks), signal tasks create powerful synchronization mechanisms that form the backbone of Compozy's [event-driven signal system](/docs/core/signals/overview).

## Core Capabilities

Signal tasks provide essential event-driven coordination features:

## Task Structure

Signal tasks use a simple yet powerful configuration structure built on Compozy's [task configuration system](/docs/core/configuration/workflows#task-configuration). Every signal task contains two essential components: the signal identification and payload data.

```yaml
id: signal-task-name
type: signal
signal:
  id: "signal-identifier"
  payload:
    data: "{{ .workflow.input.value }}"
    timestamp: "{{ now }}"
outputs:
  signal_dispatched: "{{ .task.outputs.signal_dispatched }}"
  signal_id: "{{ .task.outputs.signal_id }}"
```

</FeatureCardList>

## Integration with Wait Tasks

Signal tasks enable robust, event-driven communication between independent workflows. One workflow can notify or trigger actions in another, allowing for decoupled orchestration and real-time coordination across complex business processes. This mechanism is essential for building scalable systems where workflows need to interact, synchronize, or respond to events generated elsewhere in the platform.

<Mermaid className="my-14" chart={`sequenceDiagram
    participant WA as Workflow A (Order Processing)
    participant Signal as Signal System
    participant WB as Workflow B (Fulfillment)

    Note over WA: Process order and prepare items
    WA->>WA: Execute order processing tasks
    WA->>Signal: Send signal "order-ready-for-fulfillment"

    Note over Signal: Signal contains order details,<br/>customer info, and metadata

    Note over WB: Waiting for signal with condition:<br/>payment_confirmed == true

```yaml title="Workflow A: Order processing"

condition: 'signal.payload.order_metadata.payment_confirmed == true' # [!code highlight]
timeout: 3600s  # 1 hour

processor:

    id: fulfillment-processor
    instructions: "Process order for fulfillment"

## Best Practices

Follow these established patterns to build reliable and maintainable signal-driven workflows. These practices ensure signal tasks integrate effectively with the broader [event-driven architecture](/docs/core/signals/overview) and support debugging, monitoring, and system reliability.

## Summary

Signal tasks form the foundation of event-driven workflows in Compozy, enabling loose coupling, scalable coordination, and sophisticated inter-workflow communication patterns. Their immediate execution and flexible payload system make them ideal for creating responsive, event-driven applications.
