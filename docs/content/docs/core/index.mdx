## Why Compozy?

Developing infrastructure for multi-agent AI systems presents unique distributed systems challenges that hinder scalability and reliability. As agents evolve from simple loops to complex workflows with fan-outs and sub-agent coordination, today's tools fall short in addressing production realities:

<Steps size="lg" titleComponent="h3">
  <Step title="Distributed Complexity" icon="Puzzle">
    Multi-agent systems require handling fan-outs across thousands of sub-agents, but developers spend 70% of their time managing throughput, fault tolerance, and cost control—turning scalable automations into fragile engineering nightmares.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Proprietary Limitations" icon="SlidersHorizontal">
    Closed platforms restrict customization for agent prompts, untrusted context handling, and debugging, creating vendor lock-in that blocks innovation and escalates costs in high-volume scenarios like agentic map-reduce.
  </Step>
  <Step title="No Unified Standards" icon="BookOpen">
    The absence of standardized protocols for agent orchestration leads to reinventing wheels—teams rebuild capabilities for monitoring, error recovery, and integration, as components from one system rarely compose with others.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Orchestration Overhead" icon="GitBranch">
    Coordinating webhooks, APIs, rate limits, and sub-agent interactions demands extensive boilerplate, complicating deployment and maintenance of reliable, cost-efficient workflows at scale.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Solving these problems

Compozy provides open-source infrastructure that makes building and operating multi-agent systems routine and reliable, solving distributed challenges with high throughput, fault tolerance, and tools for effective management—empowering developers to focus on innovation:
