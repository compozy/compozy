## Why Compozy?

Building AI agents shouldn't require a PhD in machine learning or months of integration work. Yet today's AI development landscape presents significant challenges that slow down innovation and limit accessibility:

<Steps size="lg" titleComponent="h3">
  <Step title="Fragmented Development" icon={<Puzzle />}>
    Developers spend 70% of their time wrestling with integrations instead of
    building features. Connecting AI agents with databases, APIs, and external
    tools requires navigating dozens of different protocols, authentication
    methods, and data formatsâ€”turning simple automations into complex
    engineering projects.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Closed Ecosystems" icon={<SlidersHorizontal />}>
    Most AI platforms lock you into proprietary systems with limited
    customization options. When you need to modify behavior, add custom
    integrations, or understand how decisions are made, you hit a wall. This
    vendor lock-in stifles innovation and increases long-term costs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lack of Standards" icon={<BookOpen />}>
    Every AI agent platform speaks a different language. Teams waste months
    rebuilding the same capabilities because there's no standardized way to
    share, reuse, or compose agent components. What works on one platform rarely
    translates to another.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integration Complexity" icon={<GitBranch />}>
    Setting up webhooks, managing API keys, handling rate limits, and
    coordinating between multiple services requires extensive boilerplate code.
    Simple workflows become complex orchestration challenges that take weeks to
    deploy and maintain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Solving these problems

We solve these challenges by providing a comprehensive, open platform that simplifies AI agent development, deployment, and orchestration - making powerful AI capabilities accessible to developers of all skill levels:
