The MCP proxy defaults changed in September 2025 to support both embedded (standalone) and external deployment modes. Review these notes before upgrading an existing Compozy deployment.

## Port defaults and modes

- **External proxy (default)** – When `mcp_proxy.mode` is empty, Compozy continues to assume an external MCP proxy. The runtime now normalizes the port back to **6001** if no explicit port is supplied, preserving the legacy listener for existing environments.
- **Standalone proxy** – Setting `mcp_proxy.mode: standalone` embeds the proxy inside the API server. Standalone mode **requires a fixed, non-ephemeral port**; configure `mcp_proxy.port` (or `MCP_PROXY_PORT`/`--mcp-port`) with the value you want to expose.
- **Ephemeral ports** – Port `0` remains supported for advanced scenarios when running an external proxy and intentionally requesting an ephemeral port. The effective port is logged on startup; ensure your reverse proxy or load balancer reads that value before routing traffic.

## Required operator actions

1. **Check your configuration** – Confirm `mcp_proxy.mode` is either empty or set to `standalone`. Any other value now fails validation during startup.
2. **Verify ports** – If you embed the proxy (`standalone`), set a non-zero port (for example `6001`). Deployments that relied on the previous implicit 6001 default should remain unchanged because the loader backfills that port automatically.
3. **Update infrastructure automation** – If you operate health checks or security groups that referenced port 6001, review them before switching to ephemeral ports or standalone mode.
