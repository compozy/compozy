description: "Execute multiple tasks in parallel with the cp__call_tasks builtin"
---

The **cp__call_tasks** builtin fans out to multiple tasks concurrently with semaphore-bound execution and aggregated telemetry. Use it to validate or enrich data across several tasks inside a single workflow step.

## Input fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tasks` (required) | array | Ordered list of task configurations mirroring `cp__call_task`. Each entry accepts `task_id`, optional `with`, and optional `timeout_ms`. |

## Usage example

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": "validate.email",
      "with": { "value": "user@example.com" }
    },
    {
      "task_id": "validate.phone",
      "with": { "value": "+1-555-0100" }
    },
    {
      "task_id": "enrich.profile",
      "timeout_ms": 60000
    }
  ]
}
```

The builtin enforces `runtime.native_tools.call_tasks.max_concurrent`. Set the config to increase or decrease fan-out parallelism.

## Remediation hints

- Provide at least one entry in the `tasks` array.
- Ensure every task configuration includes `task_id` and respects schema requirements.
- Use per-task `timeout_ms` for long-running operations; negative values are rejected.
- Inspect per-result `error` objects to determine which task failed and why.
