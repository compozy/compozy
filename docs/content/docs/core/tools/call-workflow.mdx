title: "cp__call_workflow"
description: "Trigger a workflow synchronously with the cp__call_workflow builtin"
---

The **cp__call_workflow** builtin executes a workflow and waits for completion, returning the final status, execution ID, and output map. It enables workflow-to-workflow orchestration without leaving the current run.

## Input fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workflow_id` (required) | string | Identifier from the workflow catalog. |
| `input` | object | JSON payload forwarded to the workflow run. |
| `initial_task_id` | string | Optional task ID to resume from instead of the first task. |
| `timeout_ms` | integer | Optional timeout override for the synchronous wait. |

## Usage examples

**Standard workflow invocation**

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "user.onboarding",
  "input": {
    "user": {
      "id": "123",
      "plan": "pro"
    }
  }
}
```

**Resume from a checkpoint with a custom timeout**

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "data.pipeline",
  "initial_task_id": "resume-stage-3",
  "timeout_ms": 240000
}
```

## Remediation hints

- Confirm the workflow exists and is published before calling.
- Provide only object data in `input`; other JSON types should be wrapped accordingly.
- Increase `timeout_ms` when downstream activities run longer than the default.
- Inspect the returned `status` field to determine whether the workflow succeeded, failed, or timed out.
