title: "cp__call_workflows"
description: "Execute multiple workflows in parallel with the cp__call_workflows builtin"
---

The **cp__call_workflows** builtin dispatches several workflows concurrently, enforcing the configured concurrency ceiling and emitting detailed per-workflow results. Use it for regional fan-out, tenant processing, or staged orchestration.

## Input fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workflows` (required) | array | Ordered list of workflow configurations mirroring `cp__call_workflow`. Each entry supports `workflow_id`, optional `input`, optional `initial_task_id`, and optional `timeout_ms`. |

## Usage example

```json
{
  "workflows": [
    {
      "workflow_id": "process.region",
      "input": { "region": "us-east-1" }
    },
    {
      "workflow_id": "process.region",
      "input": { "region": "eu-west-1" },
      "timeout_ms": 180000
    }
  ]
}
```

The builtin limits concurrency to `runtime.native_tools.call_workflows.max_concurrent`. Adjust the configuration to tune throughput.

## Remediation hints

- Provide at least one entry in the `workflows` array.
- Ensure every entry includes a valid `workflow_id` and satisfies schema expectations.
- Use per-workflow `timeout_ms` values for long-running regions instead of relying on the default.
- Inspect `results[n].error` for remediation hints when a workflow fails.
