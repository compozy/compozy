## What is the Compozy CLI?

The Compozy Command Line Interface (CLI) is a comprehensive tool that serves as your primary interface for interacting with the Compozy workflow orchestration engine. It provides everything you need to create, develop, deploy, and manage AI-powered applications through simple, intuitive commands.

If you're new to Compozy, start with our [Quick Start guide](/docs/core/getting-started/quick-start) to get up and running in 5 minutes, or follow the [First Workflow tutorial](/docs/core/getting-started/first-workflow) for a hands-on introduction to building AI workflows.

## Why Use the Compozy CLI?

## Command Overview

The CLI is organized into logical command groups that map to different aspects of the Compozy system. Each command category serves a specific purpose in your workflow development lifecycle:

## Interactive vs Automation Modes

The CLI intelligently adapts its output based on your environment, providing optimal experiences for both human operators and automated systems:

- **Interactive Mode**: Rich terminal UI with colors, progress bars, and interactive prompts when running in a terminal - ideal for development workflows
- **Automation Mode**: Clean JSON output with proper exit codes when running in scripts or CI/CD pipelines - perfect for automated testing

```bash
# Interactive mode (automatic in terminal)
compozy workflow list

# Force JSON output for scripts
compozy workflow list --format json

# Quiet mode for automation
compozy workflow execute my-flow --quiet --format json
```

## Configuration and Environment

The CLI respects a configuration hierarchy with multiple sources:

1. **Command-line flags** override all other settings
2. **Environment variables** like `COMPOZY_API_KEY` for API authentication
3. **Configuration files** using the [application schema](/docs/schema/application)
4. **Default values** optimized for development
