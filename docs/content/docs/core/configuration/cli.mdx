## What is the Compozy CLI?

The Compozy Command Line Interface (CLI) is a comprehensive tool that serves as your primary interface for interacting with the [Compozy workflow orchestration engine](/docs/core/architecture/overview). It provides everything you need to create, develop, deploy, and manage AI-powered applications through simple, intuitive commands.

If you're new to Compozy, start with our [Quick Start guide](/docs/core/getting-started/quick-start) to get up and running in 5 minutes, or follow the [First Workflow tutorial](/docs/core/getting-started/first-workflow) for a hands-on introduction to building AI workflows.

## Why Use the Compozy CLI?

<List>
  <ListItem title="Rapid Project Setup">

  </ListItem>
  <ListItem title="Seamless Development">
    Run development servers with [hot-reload capabilities](/docs/cli/dev-commands#hot-reload), allowing you to iterate quickly on your [workflows](/docs/core/workflows/overview) and see changes in real-time without restarting
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem title="Workflow Management">
    Execute, monitor, and debug AI workflows with rich interactive interfaces or [automation-friendly JSON output](/docs/cli/overview#interactive-vs-automation-modes) for [CI/CD integration](/docs/deployment/ci-cd)

## Command Overview

The CLI is organized into logical command groups that map to different aspects of the Compozy system. Each command category serves a specific purpose in your workflow development lifecycle:

## Interactive vs Automation Modes

The CLI intelligently adapts its output based on your environment, providing optimal experiences for both human operators and automated systems. Learn more about [CLI output modes](/docs/cli/overview#interactive-vs-automation-modes) and [automation patterns](/docs/deployment/automation):

- **Interactive Mode**: Rich terminal UI with colors, progress bars, and interactive prompts when running in a terminal - ideal for [development workflows](/docs/cli/dev-commands)
- **Automation Mode**: Clean JSON output with proper exit codes when running in scripts or [CI/CD pipelines](/docs/deployment/ci-cd) - perfect for [automated testing](/docs/testing/automation)

```bash
# Interactive mode (automatic in terminal)
compozy workflow list

# Force JSON output for scripts
compozy workflow list --format json

# Quiet mode for automation
compozy workflow execute my-flow --quiet --format json
```

## Configuration and Environment

The CLI respects a [configuration hierarchy](/docs/core/configuration/global#configuration-precedence) with multiple sources:

1. **Command-line flags** override all other settings
2. **Environment variables** like `COMPOZY_API_KEY` for [API authentication](/docs/security/api-keys)
3. **Configuration files** using the [application schema](/docs/schema/application)
4. **Default values** optimized for development

Learn about [environment-specific configuration](/docs/deployment/environments) and [security considerations](/docs/security/configuration) for production deployments.
