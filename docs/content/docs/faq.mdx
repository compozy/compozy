### Is standalone mode production-ready?
No. It is intended for development, CI, and demos. Use [Distributed Mode](/docs/deployment/distributed-mode) for production.

### Do I need Docker for standalone?
No. Standalone embeds Temporal and the cache layerâ€”no external services required.

### Can I persist data in standalone?
Yes. Use `temporal.standalone.database_file` for Temporal and enable `redis.standalone.persistence` for cache snapshots.

### How do I switch modes?
Set the global `mode` and/or component modes. See [Mode Configuration](/docs/configuration/mode-configuration).

### What ports are used by standalone Temporal?
`frontend_port` plus the next 3 ports (history, matching, worker). UI defaults to `8233`.
