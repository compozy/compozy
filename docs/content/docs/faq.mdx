### Are embedded modes production-ready?
No. Memory and persistent modes are designed for development, CI, and demos. Use [Distributed Mode](/docs/deployment/distributed-mode) for production.

### Do I need Docker for embedded modes?
No. Embedded modes launch Temporal and the cache layer inside the Compozy processâ€”no external services required.

### Can I persist data with embedded modes?
Yes. Use `temporal.standalone.database_file` to point Temporal at a file and enable `redis.standalone.persistence` for cache snapshots.

### How do I switch modes?
Set the global `mode` and/or component overrides. See [Mode Configuration](/docs/configuration/mode-configuration).

### What ports are used by embedded Temporal?
`frontend_port` plus the next three ports (history, matching, worker). The UI defaults to `8233`.
