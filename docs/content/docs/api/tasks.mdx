Task management operations

## Streaming Endpoint

`GET /executions/tasks/{exec_id}/stream` mirrors the agent streaming behavior for task executions. Structured outputs stream as JSON events; tasks without an output schema stream human-readable `llm_chunk` text lines for fast console-style updates.

| Parameter | Location | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exec_id` | Path | Task execution identifier. |
| `Last-Event-ID` | Header | Resume structured streams from the last delivered event ID. |
| `poll_ms` | Query | Polling interval for repository snapshots (default `500`, min `250`, max `2000`). |
| `events` | Query | Comma-separated allowlist to reduce event types (default: all). |

Heartbeats are emitted every 15 seconds to keep load balancers aware of the connection. Text-mode reconnects start streaming new chunks while final status events remain durable. Review the [Execution Stream Events schema](/docs/schema/execution-stream-events) for payload definitions.
