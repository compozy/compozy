Workflow management operations

## Streaming Endpoint

`GET /executions/workflows/{exec_id}/stream` delivers a durable Server-Sent Events feed for workflow executions. Clients receive ordered events (`workflow_status`, `tool_call`, `complete`, `error`, and more) with monotonically increasing IDs and can resume after interruptions by sending the `Last-Event-ID` header.

| Parameter | Location | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exec_id` | Path | Workflow execution identifier. |
| `Last-Event-ID` | Header | Resume from the last processed event ID. |
| `poll_ms` | Query | Polling cadence for Temporal snapshots (default `500`, min `250`, max `2000`). |
| `events` | Query | Comma-separated allowlist of event types to emit (default: all). |

The stream sets `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, `Cache-Control: no-cache`, `Connection: keep-alive`, and emits heartbeats every 15 seconds to keep intermediaries aware of the open connection. Refer to the [Execution Stream Events schema](/docs/schema/execution-stream-events) for complete payload definitions.
