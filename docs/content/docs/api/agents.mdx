Agent management operations

## Streaming Endpoint

`GET /executions/agents/{agent_exec_id}/stream` provides live agent execution updates over Server-Sent Events. When an agent declares an output schema the stream emits structured JSON events; otherwise the handler forwards progressive `llm_chunk` text sourced from the worker publisher.

| Parameter | Location | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_exec_id` | Path | Agent execution identifier. |
| `Last-Event-ID` | Header | Resume structured streams from the last delivered event ID. |
| `poll_ms` | Query | Polling interval for repository snapshots (default `500`, min `250`, max `2000`). |
| `events` | Query | Comma-separated allowlist to reduce event types (default: all). |

In text mode, reconnects begin streaming from “now” while final completion events remain durable. Structured mode supports full resumption semantics. See the [Execution Stream Events schema](/docs/schema/execution-stream-events) for event catalog details.
