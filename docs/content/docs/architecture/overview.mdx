Compozy can run everything on your laptop (memory or persistent embedded modes) or connect to managed infrastructure (distributed). The workflow engine (Temporal) and cache are the main components that switch behavior between modes.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Embedded (memory & persistent)
    C1[Compozy] --> T1[Embedded Temporal]
    C1 --> R1[Embedded Cache]
    T1 --> UI[Temporal UI]
  end

  subgraph Distributed
    C2[Compozy] --> T2[Temporal Cluster]
    C2 --> R2[Managed Redis]
  end
```

See the inâ€‘depth pages for each component:
