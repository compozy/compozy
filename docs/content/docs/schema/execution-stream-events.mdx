## Overview

Execution streams emit Server-Sent Events (SSE) with a consistent structure across workflows, agents, and tasks. Each frame includes:

- `id` — monotonically increasing integer.
- `event` — event type token.
- `data` — JSON object for structured streams or plain text for `llm_chunk`.

Heartbeats are sent every 15 seconds as comment frames (`: ping`) to keep intermediaries aware of the open connection.

```text
id: 42
event: workflow_status
data: {"status":"RUNNING","step":"agent_start","ts":"2025-10-22T16:05:31.431Z"}
```

## Event Catalog

| Event | Component | Data Shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workflow_start` | Workflow | JSON `{ exec_id, ts, workflow_id }` | Emitted once when the workflow begins. |
| `workflow_status` | Workflow | JSON `{ status, step?, usage?, ts }` | Durable status transitions with optional usage deltas. |
| `agent_start` | Workflow/Agent | JSON `{ agent_id, ts, step? }` | Signals the start of an agent step within a workflow. |
| `tool_call` | Workflow/Agent | JSON `{ tool_name, args, ts }` | Records structured tool invocations. |
| `agent_status` | Agent | JSON `{ status, ts, component }` | High-level agent status updates. |
| `task_status` | Task | JSON `{ status, ts, component }` | High-level task status updates. |
| `structured_delta` | Agent/Task | JSON `{ partial, ts }` | Optional structured partial outputs when schemas are present. |
| `llm_chunk` | Agent/Task | Text line | Progressive text chunks; best-effort delivery. |
| `complete` | All | JSON `{ status, result?, usage?, duration_ms? }` | Terminal success payload. |
| `error` | All | JSON `{ message, code?, ts }` | Terminal failure payload. |

> Structured mode events (`workflow_*`, `agent_status`, `task_status`, `structured_delta`, `complete`, `error`) support resumption via `Last-Event-ID`. Text-mode `llm_chunk` events are not replayed on reconnect; rely on the final completion event for durability.

## Resume Semantics

- **Durable streams (workflows and structured agent/task)** cache the last event ID. Provide `Last-Event-ID` on reconnect to receive only newer events.
- **Text-mode streams** (`llm_chunk`) resume from “now” when reconnecting. Persist the accumulated output client-side if you need a complete transcript.
- The `poll_ms` query parameter (default `500`, allowed `250`-`2000`) tunes Temporal/repository polling for durable streams. Use the `events` query parameter to reduce traffic to specific event types.

## Client Checklists

- Always set `Accept: text/event-stream` and disable HTTP buffering proxies (for example, `curl -N`).
- Persist the last processed `id` for durable streams to resume cleanly.
- Expect periodic heartbeats (`: ping`) and ignore them in parsers.
- Close the stream after receiving `complete` or `error` to free server resources.
