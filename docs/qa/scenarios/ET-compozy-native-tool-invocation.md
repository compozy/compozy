title: Invoke native tools through the Compozy namespaces
persona: Ada
journey: J-validate-compozy-hard-cut
expected: A managed session, including Codex on a macOS CGO-disabled build, and the operator CLI discover and invoke compozy__ native tools; hosted MCP advertises only compozy_host__ façade names from compozy-hosted-tools, and retired identifiers resolve as unknown without aliases.
entry_points: compozy tool list|search|info|invoke -o json; managed session tool call; compozy mcp serve; hosted MCP tools/list and tools/call
qa_status: pass

Passed in the 2026-07-30 final rerun: a real Codex-managed task-role session bound nine hosted
native descriptors in 4 ms, claimed run `run-d24b7bddfc76b2d4`, maintained its lease with two
heartbeats, and completed it through `compozy__task_run_complete`. The resulting Go canary service
passed three tests; Python and shell verification also passed. This directly exercises managed
session calls through `compozy-hosted-tools` without a CLI lease substitute.

QA impact 2026-07-26: native ToolIDs, ToolsetIDs, and the hosted MCP façade now
use the Compozy namespaces. Planning flag only; the next QA cycle owns real
managed-session invocation plus explicit legacy-identifier rejection.
