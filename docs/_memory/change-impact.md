# Compozy Change Impact

Use for changed runtime behavior, public contracts, config, or feature documentation. Record this analysis once in the owning spec/task/PR and link it from implementation slices; update only the affected entries. A small change needs only concise findings. Editorial changes with no runtime contract may state `not applicable — editorial only`.

- **Native tools:** changed `compozy__*` IDs, toolsets, descriptors, schemas/digests, risk flags, capability gates, diagnostics, and CLI/API fallbacks.
- **Extensibility and hooks:** extensions, hooks, skills/capabilities, resources, registries, bridge SDKs, MCP sidecars, and config lifecycle. Config changes co-ship defaults, loader/overlay behavior, validation, docs, and compatibility under SD-013.
- **Workspace data isolation:** classify changed data as global/workspace/session/agent-scoped. Follow `workspace_id` through affected CLI/HTTP/UDS/core/store/web/cache/SSE/event paths and verify the owning boundary prevents cross-workspace leakage.
- **Official Compozy skill:** update `skills/compozy/` when public behavior, tools, CLI paths, hooks, capabilities, resources, or memory/network/task semantics change.
- **Web/Docs impact:** name affected `web/` routes/components/hooks and `packages/site` docs, plus their verification owner. Backend changes carry this analysis with the feature.

For an unaffected entry, name the checked surfaces and why the change cannot affect them. Do not create separate artifacts or re-audit unchanged surfaces for every checkpoint. Breaking changes also name delete targets and the user-state/public/internal compatibility regime; apply SD-013 before deletion.

## Issue 595 — Goal lifecycle and attention

Owning delivery: [PR #601](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/601). Detailed regression and runtime evidence: [focused QA report](../qa/reports/2026-09-10-issue-595-goal-lifecycle.md).

- **Native tools:** Existing Goal control/read, session stop/removal, and Loop cancellation surfaces keep their IDs, schemas, and authorization. Run terminal state and quarantine govern Goal status. Stopping a session cancels its session-origin Goals; failed cancellation remains retryable in the existing stop settlement receipt.
- **Extensibility and hooks:** No hook, SDK, configuration, or registry shape changes. Cancellation uses the existing aggregate and durable cleanup outbox. Catalog Loop lineage and window dismissal retain their semantics.
- **Workspace data isolation:** Binding adoption validates workspace, task, control, phase, session, handle, and epoch. Session Goal cancellation reads immutable profile/workspace scope. Existing receipts preserve session/runtime identity across restart. No schema migration or historical record deletion.
- **Official Compozy skill:** `skills/compozy/references/loops.md` documents cancellation, orphan recovery, context ownership, and bounded supervision freshness.
- **Web/Docs:** Session badges, Goal strip, Tasks, and Loop detail consume corrected backend projections; no client-side badge clearing. The Goals guide and GL/LP/RT QA slices accompany the change. Canonical lifecycle suites and focused CLI/API/Web runtime walks own validation; remaining delivery gates run in CI.

## Merged PRs 596, 597, 599, 600, and 601

The [main-branch remediation report](../qa/reports/2026-09-10-merged-pr-ci-review-remediation.md)
owns the follow-up audit: captured terminal creation scope, stale-navigation
rejection, explicit title-disclosure action names, public session imports, and
review/CI disposition. Existing native, persisted, configuration, and official
skill contracts remain unchanged.

## Issue 605 — Mixed reasoning and tool work groups

- **Native tools:** No IDs, schemas, descriptors, CLI, HTTP or UDS changes. The Web projects existing reasoning and tool parts into one ordered work segment.
- **Extensibility and hooks:** Tool registration, MCP, extensions, hooks, bridge progress and config remain unchanged. Deliberate terminal tools retain their separate interactive rows.
- **Workspace data isolation:** Group anchors and disclosure state remain local to each message's timeline store. Persisted transcript, session/workspace keys and SSE contracts are unchanged; no migration or recovery action is needed.
- **Official Compozy skill:** No update required: public agent operations and protocol semantics are unchanged.
- **Web/Docs:** Timeline projection, work entries, group identity/equality, turn folds, and find reveal consume the widened internal entry union. The virtualizer already estimates work from entry count and measures actual expanded DOM. RT-048 and RT-055 own the updated behavior; canonical projection, thread/navigation and scroll suites plus rendered QA verify it. Public site documentation has no changed API or operational instructions.
