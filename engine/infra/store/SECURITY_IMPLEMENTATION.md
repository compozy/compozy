# Multi-Tenant Security Implementation Status

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of multi-tenant security measures in the Compozy data access layer.

## Security Issues Addressed

### ✅ CRITICAL - FilterInsertByOrganization (RESOLVED)

- **Issue**: Method did not exist in codebase
- **Status**: Not applicable - method was removed in favor of better patterns
- **Resolution**: All insert operations now use `MustGetOrganizationID` to enforce organization context

### ✅ HIGH - Empty ID Validation (RESOLVED)

- **Issue**: PreventCrossOrgAccess didn't properly validate empty/zero-value IDs
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Changes**:
    - Added `isValidOrgID` helper function to check for empty strings and zero-value UUIDs
    - Updated `PreventCrossOrgAccess` to validate both context and target org IDs
    - Added comprehensive test coverage in `query_filters_test.go` and `security_validation_test.go`

### ✅ HIGH - GetOrganizationID Access (RESOLVED)

- **Issue**: Methods needed to be private to prevent misuse
- **Status**: Already implemented correctly
- **Current State**:
    - `getOrganizationID` methods in both `taskrepo.go` and `workflowrepo.go` are private (lowercase)
    - Methods include comprehensive security warnings in comments
    - Only accessible through secure helper functions `EstablishOrgContextFromWorkflow` and `EstablishOrgContextFromTask`

### ✅ MEDIUM - Missing Context Enforcement (RESOLVED)

- **Issue**: Write paths needed validation for missing org context
- **Status**: Fully implemented
- **Implementation**:
    - `MustGetOrganizationID` function enforces organization context on all write paths
    - Function panics if org context is missing, empty, or zero-value UUID
    - All write methods (`UpsertState`, `CreateChildStatesInTransaction`) use this function
    - Comprehensive test coverage in `must_get_org_id_test.go`

### ✅ MEDIUM - Database Defense-in-Depth (RESOLVED)

- **Issue**: Need CHECK constraints at database level
- **Status**: Migration created
- **Implementation**:
    - Created migration `20250621000000_add_org_id_check_constraints.sql`
    - Adds CHECK constraints to prevent empty or zero-value org IDs in:
        - workflow_states
        - task_states
        - organizations
        - users
        - api_keys
    - Also adds performance indexes for org-scoped queries

## Security Patterns Implemented

### 1. Context-Based Tenant Isolation

- All queries automatically filter by organization ID from context
- Organization ID is enforced from context, never from user input
- Helper functions for establishing context from trusted sources

### 2. Write Path Protection

- `MustGetOrganizationID` enforces fail-safe behavior
- Panics on missing/invalid org context to catch bugs during development
- All write operations overwrite input org ID with context value

### 3. Read Path Protection

- All SELECT queries use `ApplyOrgFilter` to add WHERE org_id clause
- UPDATE and DELETE operations use filtered query builders
- No raw SQL queries allowed - all use Squirrel query builder

### 4. Database-Level Protection

- CHECK constraints prevent empty/zero-value org IDs
- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- Composite indexes optimize tenant-isolated queries

### 5. Private Method Protection

- `getOrganizationID` methods are private to prevent direct access
- Only accessible through secure helper functions for internal use
- Comprehensive security warnings in code comments

## Testing Coverage

### Test Files

- `query_filters_test.go` - Tests for PreventCrossOrgAccess validation
- `organization_context_test.go` - Tests for organization context helpers
- `must_get_org_id_test.go` - Tests for MustGetOrganizationID panic behavior
- `security_validation_test.go` - Comprehensive security validation tests

### Test Scenarios Covered

- Empty string organization IDs
- Zero-value UUID organization IDs
- Missing organization context
- Cross-organization access attempts
- Valid organization ID flows

## Usage Guidelines

### For API Handlers

```go
// Always establish org context from authenticated user
ctx = store.WithOrganizationID(ctx, user.OrgID)
```

### For Write Operations

```go
// Organization ID is automatically enforced from context
state.OrgID = store.MustGetOrganizationID(ctx) // This overwrites any input value
```

### For Internal Services

```go
// Only for trusted services like activity workers
ctx, err = store.EstablishOrgContextFromWorkflow(ctx, repo, workflowExecID)
```

## Security Checklist

- ✅ All write paths use MustGetOrganizationID
- ✅ All read paths use ApplyOrgFilter
- ✅ PreventCrossOrgAccess validates empty/zero IDs
- ✅ getOrganizationID methods are private
- ✅ Database CHECK constraints in place
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Security documentation complete

## Alpha Phase Notes

Since we're in alpha, we've made breaking changes to improve security:

- Removed deprecated methods
- Added strict validation that may break existing code
- Enforced fail-safe behavior with panics on write paths

These changes prioritize security over backward compatibility, which is appropriate for the alpha phase.
