# Task Rules Fixes Summary

## All Recommendations Addressed

### 1. ✅ Path Placeholder Standardization

- **Fixed**: Replaced all instances of `<feature>` with `[feature-slug]` in task-generate-list.mdc
- **Result**: Consistent path placeholders across all rules (PRD, Tech Spec, and Tasks)

### 2. ✅ Testing Requirements Clarification

- **Fixed**: Removed sub-task testing requirement
- **Updated**: Lint and test only required before parent task completion
- **Files**: task-developing.mdc, task-generate-list.mdc, task-review.mdc
- **Result**: No more contradictory requirements about when to run tests

### 3. ✅ Process Order Optimization

- **Fixed**: Reordered phases in task-generate-list.mdc:
    - Phase 1: Generate parent tasks
    - Phase 2: Analyze complexity (moved earlier)
    - Phase 3: Generate sub-tasks based on complexity
- **Result**: More efficient workflow without re-editing files

### 4. ❌ DRY Principle (Skipped per user request)

- **Not Fixed**: Quality requirements remain duplicated
- **Reason**: User specified no problem with repetition

### 5. ✅ Impact Analysis Integration

- **Fixed**: Added instruction to include affected files from Tech Spec's Impact Analysis
- **Updated**: Step 8 in task-generate-list.mdc now references Impact Analysis
- **Added**: "Components impacted" to Success Criteria in task template
- **Result**: Better integration with Tech Spec work

### 6. ✅ Fixed Hardcoded Examples

- **Fixed**: Replaced "prd-monitoring" with `[feature-slug]` in task-review.mdc
- **Result**: Generic, reusable examples

### 7. ✅ Minor Fixes

- **Grammar**: Fixed as part of testing requirements update
- **YAML comments**: Already correct
- **Impacted components**: Added to task template

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: All rules now use `[feature-slug]` placeholder
2. **Clarity**: Testing requirements are clear - only at parent task completion
3. **Efficiency**: Complexity analysis happens before sub-task creation
4. **Integration**: Task generation properly leverages Tech Spec's Impact Analysis
5. **Maintainability**: Generic examples instead of hardcoded values

## Result

The task rules now properly align with the PRD and Tech Spec process:

- No contradictions
- Clear workflow progression
- Appropriate complexity without over-engineering
- Consistent quality standards enforcement
