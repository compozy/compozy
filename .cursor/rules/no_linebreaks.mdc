- Don't need to add extra line breaks between variables definitions and code blocks
- When writing a function, mainly small functions, don't need line breaks

## Bad

```go
func Foo() {
    bar := "bar"

    bar := "baz"

    return
}
```

## Good

```go
func Foo() {
    bar := "bar"
    bar := "baz"
    return
}
```
