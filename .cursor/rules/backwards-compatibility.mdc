## Backwards Compatibility

**NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY REQUIRED** - Compozy is currently in active development/alpha phase.

When developing, refactoring, or fixing features:

- Feel free to make breaking changes to APIs, configs, and data structures
- Don't worry about maintaining old interfaces or migration paths
- Focus on building the best architecture and design patterns
- Prioritize code quality and maintainability over compatibility

<critical>
**YOU SHOULD ALWAYS** have in mind that this should be done in a greenfield approach, we don't need to care about backwards compatibility since the project is in alpha, and support old and new stuff just introduces more complexity in the project; never sacrifice quality because of backwards compatibility
