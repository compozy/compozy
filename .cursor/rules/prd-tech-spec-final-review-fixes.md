# Final Review Fixes Applied

## Based on Gemini and O3 Reviews

### 1. ✅ Promoted Impact Analysis to Top-Level Section

- **Changed**: Impact Analysis is now section 5 in the Tech Spec structure
- **Updated**: Tech Spec template with dedicated Impact Analysis section including table format
- **Result**: Proper visibility for this critical safety feature

### 2. ✅ Kept Zen MCP Mandatory

- **Decision**: Zen MCP remains mandatory as it's a critical part of the quality process
- **Rationale**: Ensures consistent, high-quality analysis for all PRDs and Tech Specs

### 3. ✅ Clarified Dependencies in PRD

- **Changed**: PRD checklist now specifies "product-level dependencies"
- **Changed**: Also clarified "High-level constraints" instead of vague "technical considerations"
- **Result**: Maintains clear separation from technical dependencies

### 4. ✅ Added PRD Cleanup Tracking

- **Added**: Instruction to create `PRD-cleanup.md` when technical details found in PRD
- **Result**: Clear mechanism to track and fix separation violations

### 5. ✅ Fixed Template Path References

- **Changed**: Both rules now use relative paths `tasks/docs/_*.md`
- **Removed**: Editor-specific `@` aliases
- **Result**: More portable across different tools

### 6. ✅ Clarified Risk Sections

- **Changed**: PRD template now explicitly says "non-technical risks"
- **Result**: Prevents accidental inclusion of technical risks in PRD
