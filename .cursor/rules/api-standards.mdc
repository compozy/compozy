# API Development Standards

## Core Standards

- RESTful design with consistent responses
- Proper error responses with structured format
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Implement proper authentication/authorization
- Rate limiting and request validation

## Implementation Guidelines

- API versioned at `/api/v0/`
- Update Swagger annotations for API changes
- Generate docs at `/swagger/index.html`
- Use `gin-gonic/gin` for HTTP APIs
- Consistent response formats across all endpoints
