<critical>
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALWAYS** check dependent files APIs before write tests to avoid write wrong code
- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
    - Architecture patterns: @.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc
    - Go coding standards: @.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc
    - Testing requirements: @.cursor/rules/test-standard.mdc
    - API standards: @.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc
    - Security & quality: @.cursor/rules/quality-security.md
    - GoGraph MCP tools: @.cursor/rules/gograph.mdc
    - No Backwards Compatibility: @.cursor/rules/backwards-compatibility.mdc
- **MUST** use `logger.FromContext(ctx)` - NEVER use logger as function parameter or dependency injection
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test` before completing ANY subtask
- **MUST** follow @.cursor/rules/task-review.mdc workflow for parent tasks
**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
