# Cursor Development Rules for Compozy

## Backwards Compatibility

**NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY REQUIRED** - Compozy is currently in active development/alpha phase.

When developing, refactoring, or fixing features:

- Feel free to make breaking changes to APIs, configs, and data structures
- Don't worry about maintaining old interfaces or migration paths
- Focus on building the best architecture and design patterns
- Prioritize code quality and maintainability over compatibility

This policy applies to:

- Database schema changes
- API endpoint modifications
- Configuration file structure
- Internal interfaces and contracts
- Tool and workflow definitions

Once we reach beta/stable release, we'll implement proper versioning and compatibility policies.
