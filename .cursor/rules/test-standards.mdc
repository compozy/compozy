# Test Standards for Compozy Go Development

<critical>
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use `t.Run("Should describe behavior")` pattern for ALL tests
- Use `stretchr/testify` for assertions and mocks
- Integration tests MUST be in `test/integration/` directory
- Achieve >80% coverage for business logic packages
- **NEVER use testify suite patterns** - use direct functions with `*testing.T`
</critical>

## Anti-Patterns - NEVER DO THESE

**Based on analysis of 4,000+ tests showing 75-80% redundancy:**

### Redundant Tests
- Cross-package validation duplication (same validation logic in multiple packages)
- Identical mock setup patterns repeated across files
- Constructor tests that only verify non-nil objects
- Getter/setter tests without business logic

### Low-Value Tests
- Testing Go standard library functionality
- Testing obvious field assignments
- Testing interface implementations without custom logic
- Mock-heavy tests (90% setup, 10% logic)

### Prohibited Patterns
- `suite.Suite` embedding or any suite-based structures
- Suite methods like `s.Equal()`, `s.NoError()`, `s.T()`
- Weak assertions like `assert.Error(t, err)` without specific validation
- Duplicate integration/unit test coverage

## Required Patterns

### Test Structure
```go
func TestService_Method(t *testing.T) {
    t.Run("Should execute workflow and transition state correctly", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Test actual business logic and state transitions
        workflow := &Workflow{State: StateRunning}
        result, err := workflow.Execute(validInput)

        // Specific assertions about behavior
        require.NoError(t, err)
        assert.Equal(t, StateCompleted, workflow.State)
        assert.Equal(t, expectedOutput, result.Output)
        assert.True(t, workflow.CompletedAt.After(workflow.StartedAt))
    })
}
```

### Mock Usage
```go
type MockService struct {
    mock.Mock
}

func (m *MockService) DoSomething(ctx context.Context, param string) error {
    args := m.Called(ctx, param)
    return args.Error(0)
}

// Use mocks ONLY for external dependencies or complex interfaces
```

### Error Validation
```go
// ✅ SPECIFIC error validation
assert.ErrorContains(t, err, "validation failed")
var securityErr *SecurityError
assert.ErrorAs(t, err, &securityErr)

// ❌ WEAK validation
assert.Error(t, err) // Don't do this
```

## Test Value Requirements

**EVERY TEST MUST:**
- Test meaningful business logic, not trivial operations
- Verify behavior outcomes, not just function execution
- Use specific assertions about expected results
- Test critical paths: workflows, state management, error handling
- Focus on integration points between components

**BEFORE WRITING ANY TEST, ASK:**
1. Does this test verify meaningful business logic?
2. Would this test fail if business requirements change?
3. Is this functionality already tested elsewhere?
4. Does this test contribute to meaningful coverage?

**IF ANY ANSWER IS NO: Reconsider or redesign the test.**

## Test Organization

### Structure
- Unit tests: `*_test.go` alongside implementation files
- Integration tests: **MUST** be in `test/integration/` directory
- Use `test/helpers/` for shared test utilities
- Mock external dependencies using `testify/mock`

### Coverage Requirements
- Business logic packages: ≥80% coverage
- All exported functions must have meaningful tests
- Focus on critical paths, not trivial getters/setters
- Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms

### Shared Patterns
- Create generic validation test frameworks
- Use shared mock factories for common patterns
- Extract common test patterns into reusable helpers
- Consolidate identical scenarios across packages

## Implementation Guidelines

### Immediate Actions
1. **Search First:** Check if similar functionality is already tested
2. **Consolidate:** Use existing test helpers and frameworks
3. **Focus:** Test business logic and critical paths only
4. **Validate:** Ensure specific assertions about behavior
5. **Review:** Apply value requirements before submitting

### When Reviewing Tests
- Reject tests matching anti-patterns above
- Require consolidation of duplicate scenarios
- Demand specific error validation
- Enforce business logic testing over framework testing
- Verify tests can fail when business logic breaks

This consolidated standard prevents test redundancy while maintaining quality and coverage requirements.
