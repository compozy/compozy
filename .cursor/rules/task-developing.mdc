# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD and its technical specification

## Task Implementation

<workflow type="sequential">
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
</workflow>

<completion_protocol>
1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.
- Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.
</completion_protocol>

<critical type="before_subtask_completion">
Before complete any subtasks, you need to run `make lint` and `make test-all` to ensure what you create didn't broke anything.
</critical>

<critical type="before_parent_task_completion">
Before completing the parent task (when ALL sub-tasks are [x]), you MUST follow the [task-completion.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/task-completion.mdc) workflow to ensure quality and review. This workflow is only required for parent tasks, not individual sub-tasks.
</critical>

## Task List Maintenance

<maintenance_rules>
1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.
</maintenance_rules>

## AI Instructions

<ai_workflow>
When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
</ai_workflow>

<critical type="code_quality_enforcement">
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
  - Architecture patterns: [Architecture & Design Principles](mdc:.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc)
  - Go coding standards: [Go Coding Standards](mdc:.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc)
  - Testing requirements: [Testing Standards](mdc:.cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc)
  - API standards: [API Development Standards](mdc:.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc)
  - Security & quality: [Quality and Security Standards](mdc:.cursor/rules/quality-security.mdc)
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test-all` before completing ANY subtask
- **MUST** follow [task-completion.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/task-completion.mdc) workflow for parent tasks
**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
</critical>
