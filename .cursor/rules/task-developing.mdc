# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD and its technical specification

## Task Implementation

<workflow type="sequential">
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
</workflow>

<completion_protocol>
1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.
- Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.
</completion_protocol>

<critical type="before_subtask_completion">
Before complete any subtasks, you need to run `make lint` and `make test-all` to ensure what you create didn't broke anything.
</critical>

<critical type="before_parent_task_completion">
Before completing the parent task (when ALL sub-tasks are [x]), you MUST follow the [task-completion.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/task-completion.mdc) workflow to ensure quality and review. This workflow is only required for parent tasks, not individual sub-tasks.
</critical>

## Task List Maintenance

<maintenance_rules>
1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.
</maintenance_rules>

## AI Instructions

<ai_workflow>
When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
