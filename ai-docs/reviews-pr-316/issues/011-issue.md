# Issue 11 - Review Thread Comment

**File:** `sdk/client/workflow.go:60`
**Date:** 2025-10-31 14:57:18 America/Sao_Paulo
**Status:** - [x] RESOLVED

## Body

_ðŸ§¹ Nitpick_ | _ðŸ”µ Trivial_

**Consider extracting common execution logic.**

`ExecuteWorkflow` and `ExecuteWorkflowSync` share nearly identical structure with only path suffix and expected status code differing. This duplication also appears in `sdk/client/task.go`. Consider extracting a shared helper across both files to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
