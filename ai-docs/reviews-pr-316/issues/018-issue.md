**Verify Temporal connectivity test approach.**

The test creates a TCP listener for Temporal but never starts an actual Temporal server. This means the engine will attempt to connect to an address where nothing is listening, which could lead to connection timeouts or errors during engine startup or execution.



If this test is intended to validate Temporal connectivity, consider either:
1. Using a mock Temporal server or test harness
2. Skipping Temporal validation in integration tests where a real Temporal instance isn't available
3. Documenting that connection failures are expected and handled gracefully

Run the following to check how the engine handles Temporal connection failures in distributed mode:

**Test will fail due to missing Temporal server—engine connectivity validation will reject the empty listener.**

The review comment correctly identifies the issue. The test creates a TCP listener and assigns its address to `cfg.Temporal.HostPort`, but then calls `engine.Start(ctx)` expecting success. However, during startup:

1. The engine calls `bootstrapDistributed()` which validates Temporal connectivity via `isHostPortReachable()`
2. This attempts to actually connect to the address
3. Since no server is listening on the reserved port, the connection fails
4. `createTemporalClient()` returns an error, propagating up through worker initialization
5. `engine.Start(ctx)` fails



The test needs either:
- An actual embedded Temporal server (see `engine/worker/embedded/server.go`)
- Or conditional setup to skip Temporal validation in test mode
- Or removal of `require.NoError()` to expect and verify the expected failure

Reference the pattern in `lifecycle_test.go` (lines 93-98) where `cfg.Temporal.Standalone.FrontendPort` is set to a real listening port after finding one, or use the embedded server pattern from `standalone.go` and `engine/infra/server/dependencies.go`.

```
In sdk/compozy/integration/distributed_integration_test.go around lines 30-33,
the test assigns a free TCP address to cfg.Temporal.HostPort but no Temporal
server is started, so engine.Start(ctx) fails during connectivity validation;
fix by either starting an embedded Temporal server and set cfg.Temporal.HostPort
to that server’s listening address before calling engine.Start, or mirror
lifecycle_test.go and create a real net.Listener for the Temporal frontend (or
use the embedded standalone server helpers) so the host:port is reachable, or if
the test intends to assert failure, replace require.NoError with an assertion
that engine.Start returns the expected error; implement one of these approaches
to ensure the test outcome matches the environment.
