**Status:** - [x] RESOLVED

## Body

_‚ö†Ô∏è Potential issue_ | _üü† Major_

**Restructure this test into `t.Run("Should ‚Ä¶")` subtests.**

Per the testing guidelines, every Go test must express behaviors via `t.Run("Should ‚Ä¶", ‚Ä¶)` subtests. This function runs multiple scenarios in a single block with no subtests, so it doesn‚Äôt meet the requirement. Break the success and failure paths into clearly named `t.Run("Should ‚Ä¶")` blocks (and use testify assertions if they aren‚Äôt already in place) to align with the mandated pattern.

```
In sdk/compozy/cleanup_test.go around lines 24 to 48, the test currently
exercises multiple scenarios in one function; split it into t.Run("Should ...")
subtests for each behavior: one subtest that verifies cleanupModeResources
returns an error and increments called twice, one subtest that exercises
cleanupStore (success path), and one subtest that sets engine.project and a
failingStore then asserts RegisterTool returns an error and that engine.tools is
empty; move the relevant setup and assertions into clearly named t.Run blocks
(using the existing require/assert calls) so each behavior is isolated and
self-describing.
