# Issue 3 - Review Thread Comment

**File:** `engine/project/schedule/config.go:85`
**Date:** 2025-11-01 01:57:01 America/Sao_Paulo
**Status:** - [x] RESOLVED

## Body

_ðŸ§¹ Nitpick_ | _ðŸ”µ Trivial_

**Add doc comments for exported validation methods**

`Config.Validate` and `RetryPolicy.Validate` are exported but have no doc comments, which violates our documentation requirements for public APIs. Please add concise 2â€“4 line comments describing what each method ensures.


As per coding guidelines.

```diff
+// Validate ensures the schedule configuration is normalized and well-formed
+// by checking identifiers, cron expression, optional timezone, and retry policy.
 func (c *Config) Validate(ctx context.Context) error {
â€¦
+// Validate verifies that the retry policy uses positive values for both attempts
+// and backoff duration before the schedule is registered.
 func (r *RetryPolicy) Validate(ctx context.Context) error {
```

```
In engine/project/schedule/config.go around lines 44 to 85, the exported methods
Config.Validate and RetryPolicy.Validate lack Go doc comments; add concise 2â€“4
line comments above each function starting with the function name (e.g.,
"Validate validates the Config ..." and "Validate validates the RetryPolicy
...") that briefly describe what the method checks/ensures (context requirement,
fields validated such as IDs, cron, timezone, retry/backoff) and any important
behavior or error conditions; keep comments idiomatic (start with the function
name) and short.
```
