`245-253`: **LGTM! Timeout now correctly treated as an error.**

The implementation properly addresses the past review feedback by returning a descriptive error when a timeout occurs during port availability checks. This fail-fast approach provides better diagnostics and prevents the server from attempting to bind to potentially conflicting ports.

The error message includes all relevant context (port, bindIP) and wraps the original error, following the project's error handling patterns.
