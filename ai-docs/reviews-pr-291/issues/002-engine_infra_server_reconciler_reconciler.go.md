# Issues for `engine/infra/server/reconciler/reconciler.go`

## Issue 2 - Review Thread Comment

**File:** `engine/infra/server/reconciler/reconciler.go:107`
**Date:** 2025-10-20 03:07:20 America/Sao_Paulo
**Status:** - [x] RESOLVED

## Body

_üßπ Nitpick_ | _üîµ Trivial_

**Consider relocating the constant closer to its usage.**

The constant is well-named and eliminates a magic string. However, since `reconcilerSubsystem` is only used within `newReconcilerMetrics` (lines 59‚Äì93), consider moving it immediately before that function for better locality of reference.



Apply this diff to relocate the constant:

```diff
+const reconcilerSubsystem = "reconciler"
+
 func newReconcilerMetrics(
 	ctx context.Context,
 ) (metric.Int64Counter, metric.Int64Counter, metric.Int64Counter, metric.Float64Histogram) {
```

And remove it from lines 106-107:

```diff
-const reconcilerSubsystem = "reconciler"
-
 func resolveStore(state *appstate.State) (resources.ResourceStore, error) {
```

In engine/infra/server/reconciler/reconciler.go around lines 106-107 the
constant reconcilerSubsystem is declared but only used inside
newReconcilerMetrics (lines 59‚Äì93); remove the declaration at 106-107 and
re-declare the constant immediately above the newReconcilerMetrics function so
the constant is colocated with its usage to improve locality and readability.
