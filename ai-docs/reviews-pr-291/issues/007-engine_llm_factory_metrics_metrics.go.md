_ðŸ§¹ Nitpick_ | _ðŸ”µ Trivial_

**Name fallback should be a named constant.**

Replace the string literal "unknown" with a package constant for clarity and reuse.

 const (
   labelFactoryType = "factory_type"
   labelName        = "name"
   unitSeconds      = "s"
+  defaultNameUnknown = "unknown"

```
In engine/llm/factory/metrics/metrics.go around lines 61 to 65, the string
literal "unknown" used as a fallback should be replaced with a package-level
named constant; add a const (e.g., const unknownFactoryType = "unknown") at the
top of the package and replace any direct uses of the literal with that constant
(and update the fallback logic to assign unknownFactoryType when finalType is
empty), ensuring all occurrences in this file/package use the new constant for
clarity and reuse.
```
