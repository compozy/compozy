🧩 Finding #1: Architectural Feature, Not Bug - Explicit Context Inheritance Required
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📍 Location: /Users/pedronauck/Dev/compozy/compozy/examples/weather/workflow.yaml:123-163
⚠️ Severity: High
📂 Category: Architecture/Logic

Root Cause:
The weather workflow failure is NOT a bug but correct architectural behavior. The engine requires explicit `with:` blocks for collection tasks to inherit workflow input. The weather workflow violates this design pattern.

Impact:
Template execution fails with "map has no entry for key 'city'" because collection tasks `activity_analysis` and `clothing_validation` lack explicit `with:` blocks to propagate workflow input `{city: "Paris"}` to child tasks.

Evidence:

- **Failing Pattern**: Weather workflow line 123-131 has collection task without `with:` block
- **Working Pattern**: Code-reviewer workflow line 60 shows explicit `with: {dir: "{{ .workflow.input.directory }}"}`
- **Engine Logic**: `injectCollectionContext` in expander.go:180-186 only merges when `parentConfig.With != nil`
- **Architectural Design**: Variable builder shows workflow input available as `"input": workflowState.Input` but requires explicit propagation

Solution Strategy:
Add explicit `with:` blocks to collection tasks in weather workflow to propagate city parameter.

🧩 Finding #2: Technical Debt - Redundant Context Injection Mechanisms  
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📍 Location: /Users/pedronauck/Dev/compozy/compozy/engine/task2/collection/config_builder.go:79-94 and /Users/pedronauck/Dev/compozy/compozy/engine/task2/collection/expander.go:180-186
⚠️ Severity: Medium
📂 Category: Architecture/Maintainability

Root Cause:
Dual mechanisms for context injection create redundancy and violate Single Responsibility Principle.

Impact:
Increased cognitive load for developers, potential for inconsistent behavior, technical debt.

Evidence:

- **Mechanism 1**: ConfigBuilder.buildMergedInput processes parent `with` blocks with template parsing
- **Mechanism 2**: Expander.injectCollectionContext performs simpler merge after ConfigBuilder runs
- Both mechanisms handle same concern with overlapping responsibilities

Solution Strategy:
Consolidate context injection logic into single mechanism (preferably ConfigBuilder as it handles template parsing).

Related Areas:

- /Users/pedronauck/Dev/compozy/compozy/engine/task2/collection/config_builder.go (primary mechanism)
- /Users/pedronauck/Dev/compozy/compozy/engine/task2/collection/expander.go (secondary mechanism)

🔗 Dependency/Flow Map
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Workflow Input `{city: "Paris"}` → Variable Builder creates `"input": workflowState.Input`
2. Collection Task (no `with:` block) → `parentConfig.With == nil`
3. injectCollectionContext merge check fails → Only collection meta-vars added `{item, index}`
4. Child Task template execution → `.input.city` lookup fails
5. **WORKING FLOW**: Collection with explicit `with:` → Parent context merged → Child has full context

🌐 Broader Context Considerations
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Reviewed Areas**: Collection context builders, template engines, workflow configurations, parent/child task relationships, input merging logic, normalization contexts, variable builders, execution activities, response handlers

**Impacted Areas Matrix**:

- Collection workflows → High impact → Critical risk → Immediate priority (workflow fix)
- Engine maintainability → Medium impact → Medium risk → Second priority (refactor consolidation)
- Developer experience → Medium impact → Low risk → Third priority (documentation)

**Unknowns/Gaps**: Other collection workflows may have similar implicit assumptions; need audit of existing examples

**Assumptions**: Explicit context inheritance is intentional design choice for maintainability and predictability

📐 Standards Compliance
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Rules satisfied**: @architecture.mdc (explicit over implicit, clean boundaries), @go-coding-standards.mdc (context-first patterns), @quality-security.mdc (input validation, secure context isolation)

**Constraints considered**: Context-first design, explicit data flow, template isolation, memory safety with Ristretto caching

**Deviations**: None identified - the architecture correctly enforces explicit context inheritance as designed

✅ Verified Sound Areas
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Template engine execution logic works correctly with proper context
- Context normalization and variable building patterns are robust
- Memory management with Ristretto cache and cleanup patterns
- Circular reference detection and depth limiting
- ULID-based deterministic task ordering
- Deep copy operations for context isolation
- Security boundaries preventing global state leakage

🎯 Fix Priority Order
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. **Immediate (Critical)**: Add explicit `with:` blocks to weather workflow collection tasks
2. **Short-term (High)**: Implement workflow validation linting for implicit context references
3. **Medium-term (Medium)**: Consolidate redundant context injection mechanisms
4. **Long-term (Low)**: Enhance developer documentation with best practices guide

**Exact Fix Required for Weather Workflow:**

```yaml
# Add to activity_analysis task
- id: activity_analysis
  type: collection
  items: "{{ .tasks.activities.output.activities }}"
  mode: parallel
  with:
    city: "{{ .workflow.input.city }}"
    weather: "{{ .tasks.weather.output }}"
  task:
    # existing task definition

# Add to clothing_validation task
- id: clothing_validation
  type: collection
  items: "{{ .tasks.clothing.output.save_data.clothing }}"
  mode: parallel
  with:
    city: "{{ .workflow.input.city }}"
    weather: "{{ .tasks.weather.output }}"
  task:
    # existing task definition
```

This analysis confirms that the weather workflow issue is not an engine bug but a violation of the explicit context inheritance pattern. The engine architecture is sound and should not be modified. The solution is to align the workflow with the established architectural pattern.

Returning control to the main agent. No changes performed.
