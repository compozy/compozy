🧩 Finding #1: Context Inheritance Regression in Collection Tasks
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📍 Location: /Users/pedronauck/Dev/compozy/compozy/engine/task2/collection/context_builder.go:72-77
⚠️ Severity: Critical
📂 Category: Runtime/Logic

Root Cause:
The `BuildIterationContext` method completely overwrites parent input context instead of merging it, causing template variables like `.input.city` to be unavailable in collection subtasks.

Impact:
Weather example workflow fails with template execution error: "template: inline:1:40: executing "inline" at <.input.city>: map has no entry for key "city". This breaks all collection workflows that rely on implicit context inheritance from parent tasks.

Evidence:

- **Code Analysis**: Lines 72-77 in context_builder.go create new `core.Input` with only `item` and `index`, discarding inherited fields
- **Execution Path**: Weather workflow input `{"city": "Paris"}` is lost when collection processes items `["current", "forecast"]`
- **Comparison**: Code-reviewer example works because it uses explicit `with:` blocks that trigger proper context merging
- **Template Engine**: Failure occurs in pkg/tplengine/engine.go when resolving `.input.city` reference

Solution Strategy:
Merge parent CurrentInput context with item/index instead of replacing it entirely. Two approaches: (1) Engine-level fix in BuildIterationContext, or (2) Workflow-level fix by adding explicit `with:` blocks.

Related Areas:

- /Users/pedronauck/Dev/compozy/compozy/engine/task2/collection/config_builder.go (buildMergedInput shows correct merging pattern)
- /Users/pedronauck/Dev/compozy/compozy/examples/weather/workflow.yaml (affected workflow)
- /Users/pedronauck/Dev/compozy/compozy/examples/code-reviewer/workflows/review.yaml (working example with explicit with: blocks)

🔗 Dependency/Flow Map
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Workflow input `{"city": "Paris"}` → Collection task with items
2. Collection task calls `BuildIterationContext` for each item
3. Method creates new `CurrentInput` with only `{item, index}` → **DROPS city**
4. Child task templates try to access `.input.city`
5. Template engine fails: "map has no entry for key 'city'"

🌐 Broader Context Considerations (REQUIRED)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- **Reviewed Areas**: context builders, template engines, collection processing, workflow configurations, parent/child task relationships, input merging logic
- **Impacted Areas Matrix**:
  - Collection tasks → High impact → Critical risk → Immediate priority
  - Template execution → High impact → Critical risk → Immediate priority
  - Context inheritance → High impact → Critical risk → Immediate priority
  - Workflow compatibility → Medium impact → High risk → Second priority
- **Unknowns/Gaps**: Impact on other collection workflows in production, potential similar issues in other task types
- **Assumptions**: This is a recent regression from refactoring, code-reviewer pattern represents intended behavior

📐 Standards Compliance
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- **Rules satisfied**: @go-coding-standards.mdc (deep copy usage), @architecture.mdc (context-first design), @test-standard.mdc (test coverage exists)
- **Constraints considered**: Context propagation patterns, template engine expectations, backwards compatibility
- **Deviations**: None identified - fix should restore original context inheritance behavior without violating standards

✅ Verified Sound Areas
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Template engine execution logic (pkg/tplengine/engine.go) works correctly
- Collection config builder merging logic (buildMergedInput) implements proper pattern
- Variable deep copying and context structure inheritance work correctly
- Code-reviewer workflow demonstrates proper explicit context passing

🎯 Fix Priority Order
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. **Critical**: Fix BuildIterationContext to merge parent CurrentInput with item/index instead of replacing
2. **High**: Add workflow-level fix to weather example with explicit `with:` blocks as immediate workaround
3. **Medium**: Review other collection workflows for similar context inheritance dependencies
4. **Low**: Add regression tests to prevent future context inheritance breaks
