# 🔎 Deep Analysis Phase 2: Weather Workflow Template Resolution Failure

## 📊 Critical Discovery: Templates ARE Resolving - The Issue Is Deeper

**MAJOR FINDING**: The PostgreSQL database investigation reveals that template resolution is actually WORKING correctly. All collection child tasks are receiving properly resolved weather data in their inputs. The issue is that the LLM is generating identical outputs despite receiving different inputs.

## 🧩 Database Investigation Results

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📍 **Location**: PostgreSQL task_states table analysis
⚠️ **Severity**: Critical - Previous diagnosis was incorrect
📂 **Category**: LLM Processing/Runtime

### Evidence Chain

#### 1. Template Resolution Status: ✅ WORKING

```json
// Each child task receives PROPERLY RESOLVED weather data:
{
  "city": "San Francisco",
  "item": "Exploring Golden Gate Park", // ✅ Unique per child
  "weather": {
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "humidity": 76, // ✅ Actual weather data
    "temperature": 18, // ✅ Actual weather data
    "description": "Clear sky" // ✅ Actual weather data
  }
}
```

#### 2. LLM Output Analysis: ❌ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

```json
// ALL tasks output IDENTICAL weather values despite different inputs:
{
  "analysis": {
    "weather": "Clear sky",
    "humidity": 61, // ❌ Different from input (76)
    "temperature": 24 // ❌ Different from input (18)
  }
}
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**The problem is NOT template resolution failure** as previously diagnosed. The templates `{{ .tasks.weather.output }}` are resolving correctly. The issue is:

1. **LLM Context Loss**: Despite receiving correct weather data in the input, the LLM is generating its own weather values
2. **Prompt Template Issue**: The LLM may not be properly reading the weather data from the input context
3. **Model Hallucination**: The LLM is generating consistent default values (24°C, 61% humidity) instead of using provided data

## 🎯 Revised Investigation Strategy

Based on this discovery, the investigation must shift to:

### 1. Prompt Analysis

- Examine the actual prompts being sent to the LLM
- Verify that weather data is being properly injected into prompts
- Check if the prompt templates are correctly referencing the input weather data

### 2. LLM Adapter Investigation

- Check how input context is being passed to the LLM
- Verify that the weather data is available in the prompt context
- Investigate if there's a context mapping issue

### 3. Agent Configuration Review

- Examine the tourist_guide agent configuration
- Check if the prompts are properly structured to use the weather input
- Verify JSON mode and output schema handling

## 🔗 Files Requiring Investigation

1. **examples/weather/workflow.yaml:79-86** - analyze_activity action prompt template
2. **engine/llm/adapter/** - LLM prompt context building
3. **engine/agent/config.go** - Agent prompt processing
4. **engine/task2/shared/template_context.go** - Template context for prompts

## 🌐 Impact Assessment

- **Template Resolution**: ✅ Working correctly - No changes needed to engine/task2/collection/expander.go
- **Context Building**: ✅ Working correctly - No changes needed to engine/task2/shared/context.go
- **LLM Processing**: ❌ Issue identified - Needs investigation in prompt generation and context passing

## Next Phase Required

The next phase must focus on:

1. Prompt template analysis to see how weather data should be referenced
2. LLM adapter investigation to verify context passing
3. Agent configuration review to ensure proper prompt structure
4. Actual prompt tracing to see what the LLM receives

**Previous template resolution fixes are confirmed working** - the issue is in the LLM processing layer, not the template engine.
