🧩 Finding #1: Agent Prompt Template Resolution Failure in Collection Child Tasks
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📍 Location: examples/weather/workflow.yaml:80, 91-93 (agent prompts)
⚠️ Severity: Critical
📂 Category: Runtime/Logic

Root Cause:
Agent prompts for `analyze_activity` and `validate_clothing` actions reference `{{ .tasks.weather.output }}` which is **NOT AVAILABLE** to collection child tasks due to task visibility scoping rules. Collection children exclude sibling tasks from their template context.

Impact:
All collection child tasks receive identical LLM-generated weather data instead of using the correct weather context provided by the collection's `with:` block. This causes uniform results across all activities/clothing validations instead of varied, contextually appropriate responses.

Evidence:

- **Database Analysis**: Collection children receive correct, unique inputs but produce identical outputs (all show 24°C/62% humidity instead of input's 17°C/82%)
- **Template Context Investigation**: `addNonSiblingTasks()` method excludes sibling tasks from child task template contexts (engine/task2/shared/context.go:182-184)
- **Agent Configuration Analysis**: Prompts use `{{ .tasks.weather.output | toJson }}` which fails to resolve in collection child scope
- **Collection Context**: Weather data is correctly passed via `with: { weather: "{{ .tasks.weather.output }}" }` but prompts don't reference it

Solution Strategy:
Update agent prompts to use the collection-provided context variable instead of attempting to access out-of-scope task outputs:

**Change From:**

```yaml
- id: analyze_activity
  prompt: |
    - Weather: {{ .tasks.weather.output | toJson }}

- id: validate_clothing
  prompt: |
    - Weather: {{ .tasks.weather.output | toJson }}
    - Temperature: {{ .tasks.weather.output.temperature }}
    - Humidity: {{ .tasks.weather.output.humidity }}
```

**Change To:**

```yaml
- id: analyze_activity
  prompt: |
    - Weather: {{ .weather | toJson }}

- id: validate_clothing
  prompt: |
    - Weather: {{ .weather | toJson }}
    - Temperature: {{ .weather.temperature }}
    - Humidity: {{ .weather.humidity }}
```

🧩 Finding #2: Silent Template Resolution Failure Masking Configuration Bugs
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📍 Location: pkg/tplengine/engine.go (template resolution behavior)
⚠️ Severity: Critical
📂 Category: Architecture/Debugging

Root Cause:
Template engine silently fails when `{{ .tasks.weather.output }}` cannot be resolved, leading to incomplete or null prompts being sent to LLMs. This causes LLMs to generate fallback/hallucinated data instead of failing fast with clear error messages.

Impact:
Configuration bugs become difficult to diagnose because the system produces plausible but incorrect results rather than failing with clear error messages. This masks fundamental scoping issues and leads to time-consuming debugging sessions.

Evidence:

- LLM receives incomplete prompts but generates plausible weather data
- No error logs or warnings indicate template resolution failure
- System appears to work but produces systematically incorrect results
- Database investigation was required to identify the root cause

Solution Strategy:
Implement strict template resolution mode for development/testing that fails fast on unresolved variables instead of silently substituting null/empty values.

Related Areas:

- pkg/tplengine/engine.go (template resolution behavior)
- All workflow configurations using template variables in collection contexts

🔗 Dependency/Flow Map
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Collection task `activity_analysis` creates child tasks
2. Each child gets `with: { weather: "{{ .tasks.weather.output }}" }` (✅ works)
3. Child template context built via `addNonSiblingTasks()` - excludes `weather` task
4. Agent prompt tries to resolve `{{ .tasks.weather.output }}` - fails silently
5. LLM receives incomplete prompt, generates fallback weather data
6. All children get identical fallback data instead of varied context-aware responses

🌐 Broader Context Considerations (REQUIRED)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- **Reviewed Areas**: Collection task execution, template resolution mechanics, agent prompt configuration, database execution traces, task visibility scoping, context injection, LLM prompt building
- **Impacted Areas Matrix**:
  - Weather workflow → High impact → Critical risk → Immediate priority (prompt fix)
  - All collection workflows → Medium impact → High risk → Second priority (audit other workflows)
  - Template debugging → Medium impact → Medium risk → Third priority (strict mode implementation)
- **Unknowns/Gaps**: Other collection-based workflows may have similar template scoping issues
- **Assumptions**: Collection context isolation is working as designed, issue is in prompt configuration not engine mechanics

📐 Standards Compliance
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- **Rules satisfied**: @architecture.mdc (explicit context passing), @go-coding-standards.mdc (context-first patterns), @quality-security.md (input validation and secure context isolation)
- **Constraints considered**: Template variable scoping, collection execution isolation, agent prompt best practices
- **Deviations**: None identified - fix maintains proper scoping boundaries while correcting prompt configuration

✅ Verified Sound Areas
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Collection context isolation and deep copying mechanisms work correctly
- Template resolution engine handles valid paths appropriately
- Database persistence and task execution flow function as designed
- Context injection via `with:` blocks provides proper data to child tasks

🎯 Fix Priority Order
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. **Critical**: Update agent prompts in `examples/weather/workflow.yaml` to use `{{ .weather }}` instead of `{{ .tasks.weather.output }}`
2. **High**: Test weather workflow to verify varied, contextually appropriate outputs
3. **Medium**: Audit other collection-based workflows for similar template scoping issues
4. **Low**: Consider implementing strict template resolution mode for development environments

## 📋 Investigation Summary

Through extensive database analysis, code investigation using Claude Context, RepoPrompt MCP, Serena MCP, and Zen MCP debugging, I identified the root cause of the weather workflow's uniform results issue:

**The Problem**: Agent prompts in collection child tasks attempt to reference sibling task outputs (`{{ .tasks.weather.output }}`) which are not available in their execution scope. The template engine fails silently, causing LLMs to generate identical fallback weather data instead of using the contextually appropriate data provided by the collection.

**The Evidence**: Database investigation revealed that collection children receive correct, unique inputs (17°C, 82% humidity) but produce identical outputs (24°C, 62% humidity), indicating template resolution failure rather than context sharing bugs.

**The Solution**: A simple configuration fix - update the agent prompts to reference the weather data from the collection's `with:` context (`{{ .weather }}`) instead of attempting to access out-of-scope task outputs.

This analysis demonstrates the importance of understanding template variable scoping in complex workflow orchestration systems and the value of comprehensive debugging when surface symptoms don't match underlying execution patterns.
