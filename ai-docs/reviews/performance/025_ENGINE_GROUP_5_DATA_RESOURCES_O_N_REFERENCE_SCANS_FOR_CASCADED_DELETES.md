## O(N) Reference Scans for Cascaded Deletes

**Location:** `engine/resources/` stores

**Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM

**Issue:**
Deleting a resource scans ALL resources to find references (O(N) complexity).

**Fix:** Build reverse reference index

**Impact:**

- **Delete complexity:** O(N) â†’ O(1)
- **Delete latency:** 100ms (1000 resources) â†’ 1ms

**Effort:** L (8h)  
**Risk:** Medium
