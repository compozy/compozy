# Issue 014 - Review Thread Comment

**File:** `engine/agent/router/exec_test.go:1`
**Date:** 2025-10-20 12:00:00 UTC
**Status:** - [ ] UNRESOLVED

## Body

### Code Review: exec_test.go - Performance

**Review Type:** Performance
**Severity:** Medium

#### Summary

The `exec_test.go` file contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the agent router execution endpoints. While the tests are functionally correct, there are several opportunities to reduce memory allocations, improve test execution speed, and adhere to the project's performance guidelines.

#### Findings

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues

- **Enable Parallel Test Execution**
  - **Problem**: Each subâ€‘test (`t.Run`) runs sequentially, causing the entire suite to take longer, especially as more tests are added.
  - **Impact**: Increased overall test runtime and higher CPU idle time.
  - **Fix**: Call `t.Parallel()` at the start of each subâ€‘test to allow the Go test runner to execute them concurrently.
  - **Rule Reference**: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc` â€“ Concurrency in tests.

  ```go
  t.Run("ShouldGetExecutionStatus", func(t *testing.T) {
      t.Parallel() // <â€‘â€‘ enable parallel execution
      // existing test code â€¦
  })
  ```

- **Reuse Gin Engine and Middleware Setup**
  - **Problem**: Every subâ€‘test creates a new `gin.New()` router, registers middlewares, and mounts the API routes. This repeated allocation adds unnecessary heap pressure.
  - **Impact**: More frequent GC cycles and slower test initialization.
  - **Fix**: Extract the router setup into a helper function that returns a preâ€‘configured `*gin.Engine`. The helper can be called once per test file (or per subâ€‘test if isolation is required) and the returned engine can be reused.
  - **Rule Reference**: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc` â€“ Minimize allocations in hot paths.

  ```go
  func setupRouter(state *appstate.State, repo *routertest.StubTaskRepo) *gin.Engine {
      r := gin.New()
      r.Use(appstate.StateMiddleware(state))
      r.Use(srrouter.ErrorHandler())
      r.Use(func(c *gin.Context) {
          srrouter.SetTaskRepository(c, repo)
          c.Next()
      })
      api := r.Group("/api/v0")
      Register(api)
      return r
  }
  ```

- **Avoid Unnecessary DeepCopy of Request Payload**
  - **Problem**: In `stubDirectExecutor.ExecuteSync`, the request `cfg.With` map is deepâ€‘copied via `core.DeepCopy` for every execution, even when the test does not mutate the map.
  - **Impact**: Extra allocation and CPU work for each test case.
  - **Fix**: Replace the deep copy with a shallow copy using `core.CopyMap` (or simply assign the reference if immutability is guaranteed in the test context). This reduces allocation overhead while still protecting the original map from accidental mutation.
  - **Rule Reference**: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc` â€“ Use `core.CopyMap` for map copying.

  ```go
  if cfg.With != nil {
      // shallow copy is sufficient for test isolation
      s.lastWith = core.CopyMap(cfg.With)
  } else {
      s.lastWith = nil
  }
  ```

- **Reuse JSON Decoder Buffers**
  - **Problem**: Each test unmarshals the response body with `json.Unmarshal(w.Body.Bytes(), &payload)`. This creates a new byte slice for every call.
  - **Impact**: Additional heap allocations.
  - **Fix**: Use `json.NewDecoder(w.Body).Decode(&payload)` which reads directly from the `bytes.Buffer` without allocating a new slice.
  - **Rule Reference**: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc` â€“ Prefer streaming decoders to reduce allocations.

  ```go
  dec := json.NewDecoder(w.Body)
  require.NoError(t, dec.Decode(&payload))
  ```

### ðŸ”µ Low Priority / Suggestions

- **Tableâ€‘Driven Test Consolidation**
  - **Suggestion**: Convert the many individual `t.Run` blocks into a single tableâ€‘driven test. This reduces boilerplate and can improve cache locality for test data.
  - **Benefit**: Cleaner code, easier maintenance, and marginal reduction in allocation overhead.

  ```go
  tests := []struct {
      name       string
      setup      func() (*gin.Engine, *http.Request)
      wantStatus int
  }{{
      name: "ShouldGetExecutionStatus",
      setup: func() (*gin.Engine, *http.Request) { /* â€¦ */ },
      wantStatus: http.StatusOK,
  }, /* â€¦ */ }

  for _, tt := range tests {
      t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
          t.Parallel()
          r, req := tt.setup()
          w := httptest.NewRecorder()
          r.ServeHTTP(w, req)
          require.Equal(t, tt.wantStatus, w.Code)
      })
  }
  ```

#### Rule References

- `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc`: Concurrency in tests, map copying, allocation minimization, streaming JSON decoding.
- `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`: Dependency injection via constructors (already used).

#### Impact Assessment

- **Performance Impact**: Parallel execution can cut total test suite runtime by up to ~50â€¯% on multiâ€‘core CI runners. Reducing deep copies and avoiding extra byteâ€‘slice allocations lowers GC pressure, leading to faster individual test execution.
- **Maintainability Impact**: Helper functions and tableâ€‘driven structure make the test suite easier to extend and understand.
- **Reliability Impact**: No functional changes; only performanceâ€‘related optimizations.

#### Recommendations

**Immediate Actions (Medium Priority)**

1. Add `t.Parallel()` to each subâ€‘test.
2. Replace `core.DeepCopy` with `core.CopyMap` (or a shallow copy) in `stubDirectExecutor.ExecuteSync`.
3. Refactor router setup into a reusable helper.
4. Switch to `json.NewDecoder` for response unmarshalling.

**Shortâ€‘term Improvements (Low Priority)**

1. Consolidate tests into a tableâ€‘driven format.
2. Consider reusing a single `httptest.NewRecorder` when safe.

**Longâ€‘term Enhancements**

1. Benchmark the test suite before and after changes to quantify performance gains.
2. Introduce a testâ€‘specific `sync.Pool` for reusable request bodies if the suite grows significantly.

#### Positive Aspects

- The tests are thorough and cover both success and error paths.
- Dependency injection is correctly used for the executor stub.
- Clear separation of concerns with dedicated helper types.
