## Unreleased

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- task2.Factory: `CreateTaskConfigRepository` now requires an explicit project CWD: `CreateTaskConfigRepository(configStore, cwd *core.PathCWD)`. Update call sites to pass the project CWD (e.g., from `project.Config.GetCWD()`), ensuring deterministic path propagation.

### ‚ú® Improvements

- Unified CWD handling: server no longer mutates `cfg.CLI.CWD`. The server stores its own `cwd` and passes it explicitly through config loading and app state, improving configuration immutability and hot‚Äëreload safety.
- SugarDB base path resolution centralized via `config.SugarDBBaseDir(cfg)` and used by embedded cache and MCP proxy storage, eliminating duplicate logic.
- Server shutdown is now idempotent and non‚Äëblocking when called multiple times.

### üìö Docs & Notes

- CLI dev no longer changes the process working directory. Tools or scripts that relied on process CWD should use absolute paths or `cfg.CLI.CWD`.
