  </critical>

  <workflow>
  **STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS (YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS):**

  1. **List all files** in the directory using the cp__list_files tool:
     - Tool: cp__list_files
     - Parameter: { "dir": "{{ .input.directory }}", "recursive": true }
     - Filter for Go files (.go)

  2. **Read all Go files** in the directory:
     - Use cp__read_file for each .go file discovered
     - Understand the overall structure and purpose
     - Identify relationships between files

  3. **Analyze the directory** based on your action type (performance/security/monitoring/architecture/testing/error_handling)
     - Look at the directory as a cohesive unit
     - Identify cross-file issues and patterns
     - Check for missing components or organization issues
     - Cross-reference against project rules
     - Identify violations, issues, and improvement opportunities
     - Provide specific code examples for fixes

  4. **Determine review filename**:
     - Use provided review number: {{ .input.num }} (padded to 3 digits)
     - Extract directory slug from {{ .input.directory }}:
       * Remove "engine/" prefix
       * Replace "/" with "-"
     - Use "directory-{review-type}" as title slug
     - Format: {num}-{dir-slug}-directory-{review-type}.md
     - Example: engine/agent ‚Üí 001-agent-directory-performance.md

  5. **Generate comprehensive directory review** in solve_issues.go compatible format:
     Structure (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY):
     ```
     # Issue {num} - Review Thread Comment

     **File:** `{{ .input.directory }}/:1`
     **Date:** {current_date}
     **Status:** - [ ] UNRESOLVED

     ## Body

     ### Directory Review: {directory} - {Review Type}

     {Review content with findings, recommendations, cross-file issues}

     ## Resolve

     _Note: This issue was generated from directory-level code review analysis._

     **Original analysis type:** {review_type}

     To mark this issue as resolved:
     1. Update this file's status line by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
     2. Update the grouped summary file
     3. Update `_summary.md`
     ```

  6. **Save the review** using write_file tool:
     - Determine review_type from the action being executed (performance, security, monitoring, architecture, testing, error_handling)
     - Build descriptive filename:
       * Format number as 3 digits (e.g., 001, 002)
       * Extract dir slug: remove "engine/", replace "/" with "-"
       * Append "-directory-{review_type}"
       * Result: {num}-{dir-slug}-directory-{review-type}.md
     - Output path: ai-docs/reviews/{review_type}/issues/{filename}

     Examples:
     * Action=performance, directory=engine/agent, num=1
       ‚Üí Output: ai-docs/reviews/performance/issues/001-agent-directory-performance.md

     * Action=security, directory=engine/agent/uc, num=3
       ‚Üí Output: ai-docs/reviews/security/issues/003-agent-uc-directory-security.md

     - Tool: cp__write_file
     - Parameters: { "path": "[calculated path]", "content": "[markdown report]" }

  7. **Return summary** of key findings and saved file location
  </workflow>

  <tools_usage>
  ## Using Available Tools

  You MUST use these tools in your analysis:

  1. **cp__list_files**: List all files in the target directory
     - Use to discover all Go files in {{ .input.directory }}
     - **IMPORTANT**: Always use `recursive: true` to get nested files
     - Filter for .go files only (exclude tests if needed)

  2. **cp__read_file**: Read file contents to understand the codebase
     - Read each .go file discovered
     - Understand the overall structure and relationships
     - Identify patterns and issues

  3. **cp__write_file**: Write the review document
     - **CRITICAL**: You MUST use this tool to save your review!
     - Build descriptive filename:
       * Format {{ .input.num }} as 3 digits (e.g., 001, 002)
       * Extract dir slug: remove "engine/", replace "/" with "-"
       * Append "-directory-{review_type}"
     - Format: `ai-docs/reviews/<review_type>/issues/{num}-{dir-slug}-directory-{review-type}.md`
     - Example: directory=engine/agent, num=1, review_type=performance
       ‚Üí Save to: `ai-docs/reviews/performance/issues/001-agent-directory-performance.md`
     - Use the structured markdown format from instructions (solve_issues.go compatible)

  **IMPORTANT**: You MUST actually call these tools, not just describe what you would do!
  Without calling cp__write_file, your review will not be saved!
  </tools_usage>

  <output_format>
  Your markdown reports MUST use this exact structure for solve_issues.go compatibility:
