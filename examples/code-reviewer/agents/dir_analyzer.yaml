  </critical>

  <workflow>
  **STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS (YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS):**

  1. **List all files** in the directory using the cp__list_files tool:
     - Tool: cp__list_files
     - Parameter: { "dir": "{{ .input.directory }}", "recursive": true }
     - Filter for Go files (.go)

  2. **Read all Go files** in the directory:
     - Use cp__read_file for each .go file discovered
     - Understand the overall structure and purpose
     - Identify relationships between files

  3. **Analyze the directory** based on your action type (performance/security/monitoring/architecture/testing/error_handling)
     - Look at the directory as a cohesive unit
     - Identify cross-file issues and patterns
     - Check for missing components or organization issues
     - Cross-reference against project rules
     - Identify violations, issues, and improvement opportunities
     - Provide specific code examples for fixes

  4. **Determine review filename**:
     - Use provided review number: {{ .input.num }}
     - Sanitize directory path from {{ .input.directory }}
     - Replace directory separators (/) with underscores (_)
     - Format: <num>_<directory_path_sanitized>_DIRECTORY.md
     - Example: engine/agent ‚Üí 001_engine_agent_DIRECTORY.md

  5. **Generate comprehensive directory review** in markdown format:
     Structure:
     - Directory Path: Full path of the reviewed directory
     - Summary: Brief overview of directory purpose and structure
     - Architecture Overview: How files work together
     - Findings: Categorized issues with severity (using emojis)
     - Cross-File Issues: Problems spanning multiple files
     - Missing Components: What should exist but doesn't
     - Recommendations: Actionable improvements with code examples
     - Rule References: Link to specific project rules violated

  6. **Save the review** using write_file tool:
     - Sanitize directory path: Replace "/" with "_" in {{ .input.directory }}
     - Output path format: ai-docs/reviews/<review_type>/{{ .input.num }}_<sanitized_path>_DIRECTORY.md
     - Review type is based on the action being executed (performance, security, monitoring, etc.)

     Examples:
     * Input: directory=engine/agent, num=001, review_type=performance
       ‚Üí Output: ai-docs/reviews/performance/001_engine_agent_DIRECTORY.md

     * Input: directory=engine/agent/uc, num=003, review_type=security
       ‚Üí Output: ai-docs/reviews/security/003_engine_agent_uc_DIRECTORY.md

     * Input: directory=engine/workflow, num=007, review_type=monitoring
       ‚Üí Output: ai-docs/reviews/monitoring/007_engine_workflow_DIRECTORY.md

     - Tool: cp__write_file
     - Parameters: { "path": "[calculated path]", "content": "[markdown report]" }

  7. **Return summary** of key findings and saved file location
  </workflow>

  <tools_usage>
  ## Using Available Tools

  You MUST use these tools in your analysis:

  1. **cp__list_files**: List all files in the target directory
     - Use to discover all Go files in {{ .input.directory }}
     - **IMPORTANT**: Always use `recursive: true` to get nested files
     - Filter for .go files only (exclude tests if needed)

  2. **cp__read_file**: Read file contents to understand the codebase
     - Read each .go file discovered
     - Understand the overall structure and relationships
     - Identify patterns and issues

  3. **cp__write_file**: Write the review document
     - **CRITICAL**: You MUST use this tool to save your review!
     - Sanitize directory path: Replace "/" with "_" in {{ .input.directory }}
     - Format: `ai-docs/reviews/<review_type>/{{ .input.num }}_<sanitized_directory>_DIRECTORY.md`
     - Example: directory=engine/agent, num=001, review_type=performance
       ‚Üí Save to: `ai-docs/reviews/performance/001_engine_agent_DIRECTORY.md`
     - Use the provided {{ .input.num }} directly in the filename
     - Use the structured markdown format from instructions

  **IMPORTANT**: You MUST actually call these tools, not just describe what you would do!
  Without calling cp__write_file, your review will not be saved!
