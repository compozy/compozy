# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD integration for the Compozy workflow orchestration engine. The feature will provide automated testing, security scanning, multi-platform releases, and deployment automation to transform the current manual development workflow into a fully automated, production-ready CI/CD pipeline.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Continuous Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing and quality checks on every pull request, so that code quality is maintained and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is opened or updated THEN the system SHALL run automated tests, linting, and quality checks
2. WHEN CI checks fail THEN the system SHALL prevent merging until issues are resolved
3. WHEN CI checks pass THEN the system SHALL allow merging with clear status indicators
4. WHEN tests require external dependencies THEN the system SHALL provision PostgreSQL, Redis, and other services automatically
5. WHEN running in a monorepo context THEN the system SHALL only test changed components to optimize build times

### Requirement 2: Multi-Platform Release Automation

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want automated releases with multi-platform binaries and container images, so that users can easily install and deploy Compozy across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a release tag is pushed THEN the system SHALL build binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows
2. WHEN building releases THEN the system SHALL create container images for multiple architectures
3. WHEN generating releases THEN the system SHALL automatically create changelogs from conventional commits
4. WHEN publishing releases THEN the system SHALL upload assets to GitHub Releases
5. WHEN creating container images THEN the system SHALL push them to GitHub Container Registry with proper tagging

### Requirement 3: Security and Vulnerability Management

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want automated security scanning and vulnerability detection, so that I can trust the software supply chain and identify security issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically scan for known vulnerabilities
2. WHEN container images are built THEN the system SHALL scan them for security vulnerabilities
3. WHEN security issues are found THEN the system SHALL create alerts and block releases if critical
4. WHEN generating releases THEN the system SHALL create Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for transparency
5. WHEN new vulnerabilities are discovered THEN the system SHALL automatically create pull requests for dependency updates

### Requirement 4: Documentation and Schema Automation

**User Story:** As a developer and user, I want automatically updated documentation and schemas, so that the documentation stays current with code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API code changes THEN the system SHALL regenerate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
2. WHEN schema definitions change THEN the system SHALL update generated schemas automatically
3. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL deploy it to accessible locations
4. WHEN releases are created THEN the system SHALL include updated documentation in release assets
5. WHEN breaking changes occur THEN the system SHALL highlight them in release notes

### Requirement 5: Development Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration with existing development tools and workflows, so that the CI/CD system enhances rather than disrupts current productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing Makefile targets THEN the system SHALL leverage them in CI workflows
2. WHEN caching is available THEN the system SHALL cache dependencies and build artifacts to speed up builds
3. WHEN workflows fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
4. WHEN running locally THEN developers SHALL be able to reproduce CI behavior using existing tools
5. WHEN integrating with IDEs THEN the system SHALL provide status badges and integration points

### Requirement 6: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want visibility into CI/CD pipeline performance and reliability, so that I can optimize the development process and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows run THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on duration, success rates, and resource usage
2. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and failure analysis
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert maintainers to investigate
4. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear status reporting to stakeholders
5. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL provide historical data on pipeline performance

### Requirement 7: Deployment Automation

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment capabilities for staging and production environments, so that releases can be deployed consistently and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN releases are created THEN the system SHALL support automated deployment to staging environments
2. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL validate deployment health and rollback if necessary
3. WHEN multiple environments exist THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configurations
4. WHEN deployments fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear rollback mechanisms
5. WHEN deploying containers THEN the system SHALL support orchestration platforms like Kubernetes

### Requirement 8: Branch Protection and Quality Gates

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want enforced quality gates and branch protection, so that only high-quality, tested code reaches the main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL require all CI checks to pass before merging
2. WHEN code coverage drops THEN the system SHALL prevent merging until coverage requirements are met
3. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL block merging until resolved
4. WHEN required reviewers are configured THEN the system SHALL enforce review requirements
5. WHEN status checks are required THEN the system SHALL prevent bypassing quality gates
