# Task ID: 1
# Title: Update Database Migration Files
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Migration files have been successfully updated to implement parent-child task relationships by adding parent_state_id column, foreign key constraints, performance indexes, and removing the parallel_state column
# Details:
✅ **Successfully Completed Migration Updates:**

1. **Added parent_state_id column**: `parent_state_id text` - allows NULL for root tasks
2. **Added foreign key constraint**: `CONSTRAINT fk_parent_task FOREIGN KEY (parent_state_id) REFERENCES task_states (task_exec_id) ON DELETE CASCADE` - ensures referential integrity
3. **Added performance index**: `CREATE INDEX idx_task_states_parent_id ON task_states (parent_state_id)` - optimizes parent-child queries
4. **Removed parallel_state column**: Completely eliminated the JSONB column and related indexes
5. **Updated check constraint**: Simplified execution type validation to remove parallel_state references
6. **Added hierarchical indexes**: `idx_task_states_parent_status` for efficient parent-child status queries

✅ **Key Improvements Implemented:**
- Self-referencing foreign key enables proper parent-child relationships
- CASCADE delete ensures child tasks are cleaned up when parent is deleted
- Optimized indexes for hierarchical queries and status aggregation
- Simplified constraint logic removes JSONB complexity

✅ **Migration Safety Features:**
- Proper rollback procedures included in Down section
- All indexes properly dropped during rollback
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

The migration is now ready for deployment and fully supports the new parent-child task architecture as specified in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
✅ Migration testing completed successfully:
- Verified schema changes with \d task_states command
- Confirmed foreign key constraints work correctly
- Tested rollback functionality
- Validated hierarchical indexes performance
- Ensured CASCADE delete behavior works as expected

**Next Steps for Deployment:**
- Run migration on staging environment
- Perform integration tests with updated schema
- Monitor performance of new indexes
- Validate parent-child relationship queries
