# Task ID: 8
# Title: Remove JSONB Marshaling Code
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Clean up all JSONB marshaling/unmarshaling code related to ParallelState throughout the repository layer
# Details:
1. Remove json.Marshal/Unmarshal calls for ParallelState in repository methods
2. Remove any custom JSON handling for the parallel_state column
3. Clean up any JSONB query operations (e.g., jsonb_extract_path, jsonb_set)
4. Remove database scanning code that handled JSONB to ParallelState conversion
5. Update any error handling that was specific to JSONB operations
6. Search for patterns like `json.Marshal`, `json.Unmarshal`, `jsonb` in repository files
7. Remove any database utility functions that were JSONB-specific

# Test Strategy:
Code review to ensure all JSONB operations are removed, compile tests to ensure no broken references, grep search for remaining JSONB patterns, verify no performance regressions
