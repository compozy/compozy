# Task ID: 2
# Title: Remove ParallelState Struct from Domain Model
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Eliminate the ParallelState struct entirely from the Go codebase and clean up related imports
# Details:
1. Locate and remove the ParallelState struct definition from domain models
2. Remove all imports and references to ParallelState throughout the codebase
3. Clean up any unused JSONB marshaling/unmarshaling methods specific to ParallelState
4. Update any type definitions or interfaces that referenced ParallelState
5. Use `grep -r "ParallelState" .` to find all occurrences and ensure complete removal
6. Update package documentation to reflect the removal

# Test Strategy:
Compile the project to ensure no compilation errors, run `go mod tidy` to clean dependencies, use static analysis tools like `go vet` to catch any remaining references
