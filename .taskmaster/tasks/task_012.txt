# Task ID: 12
# Title: Comprehensive Testing and Performance Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive test suite and performance benchmarks for the new parent-child architecture
# Details:
Implement comprehensive testing:
1. Unit tests for all new repository methods (ListChildren, GetTaskTree)
2. Integration tests for parent-child relationship workflows
3. Performance benchmarks comparing old JSONB vs new relational approach
4. Load testing with large numbers of parallel tasks
5. Test recursive query performance with deep task trees
6. Memory usage comparison between old and new approaches
7. Test database constraint enforcement (foreign keys, cascading deletes)
8. End-to-end workflow tests to ensure feature parity
Use Go's testing package with benchmarks:
```go
func BenchmarkGetTaskTree(b *testing.B) {
    // Benchmark recursive queries
}
```
Use tools like `go test -bench=.` and `go test -race` for comprehensive validation.

# Test Strategy:
Run full test suite with coverage reporting, performance regression testing against baseline, stress testing with concurrent operations, validate memory usage patterns, test database performance under load
