# Overview

The Compozy Worker E2E Test Suite addresses a critical gap in the current testing infrastructure. While the Compozy platform has robust unit tests for individual components, there's no comprehensive end-to-end validation of complete worker execution flows. This creates risks of integration failures, undetected workflow orchestration issues, and reduced confidence in production deployments.

**Problem**: Current worker flows have reported errors and lack integrated testing that validates complete execution paths through Temporal workflows, worker activities, state management, and database persistence.

**Solution**: A comprehensive e2e test suite that validates all worker execution types (basic, parallel, collection, router) through complete workflow lifecycles, leveraging existing test infrastructure and following established patterns.

**Value**: Increased confidence in worker reliability, faster issue detection, prevention of production failures, and a foundation for ongoing quality assurance as the platform evolves.

**Target Users**: Compozy development team, QA engineers, DevOps team responsible for deployment validation and CI/CD pipeline reliability.

# Core Features

## Comprehensive Execution Type Testing
**What**: Complete test coverage for all four worker execution types - basic tasks, router tasks, parallel tasks, and collection tasks.
**Why**: Each execution type has unique orchestration patterns, state management requirements, and failure modes that need validation.
**How**: Dedicated test suites for each type with positive scenarios, edge cases, and error conditions using real Temporal workflows and database persistence.

## Multi-Task Workflow Validation
**What**: End-to-end testing of complex workflows that combine multiple execution types, task chaining, and conditional branching.
**Why**: Production workflows rarely use single execution types in isolation - they combine patterns in complex ways that need integration testing.
**How**: Workflow scenarios that mix execution types, test task dependencies, validate output templating, and verify state transitions across the complete lifecycle.

## Error Scenario and Edge Case Coverage
**What**: Comprehensive testing of failure modes, cancellation scenarios, timeout handling, and resource exhaustion conditions.
**Why**: Production reliability depends on graceful handling of failures, proper cleanup, and predictable error propagation.
**How**: Controlled failure injection, cancellation testing, timeout validation, and verification of cleanup procedures using Temporal test utilities.

## Worker Flow Validation
**What**: Testing of worker orchestration, activity execution, and state management throughout complete workflow execution cycles.
**Why**: Worker flows are the core execution engine and need comprehensive validation to ensure reliability and correctness.
**How**: Direct testing of worker activities, use cases, and workflow orchestration without involving API routes or server components.

# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges

**Risk**: Temporal test environment differences from production behavior
**Mitigation**: Use existing shared test database for state persistence validation, leverage proven `DatabaseStateVerifier` patterns, test with realistic timing and concurrency patterns

**Risk**: Test flakiness due to timing, concurrency, or resource dependencies
**Mitigation**: Use deterministic mock providers, leverage existing test isolation patterns with unique identifiers, extend existing retry logic from `test/helpers`

**Risk**: Complex test scenarios becoming difficult to maintain and debug
**Mitigation**: Follow established test patterns from existing codebase, extend proven test builders, implement clear failure diagnostics using existing state verification helpers

## MVP Strategy and Scope Management

**Risk**: Trying to cover too many scenarios initially, delaying valuable feedback
**Mitigation**: Start with basic task execution to validate approach, ensure tests run after each phase completion, build incrementally with each execution type, prioritize common production patterns over edge cases

**Risk**: Test infrastructure becoming too complex for team adoption
**Mitigation**: Leverage existing `test/helpers` patterns extensively, provide clear documentation based on existing examples, ensure tests can be run locally with simple commands

**Risk**: Scope creep into server/API testing delaying worker focus
**Mitigation**: Explicitly limit scope to worker/ and below components, avoid API route testing, focus on workflow orchestration and activity execution only

## Resource and Integration Constraints

**Risk**: Database test isolation failures causing test interference
**Mitigation**: Use existing shared test database with proven isolation patterns, leverage existing unique test identifier systems, verify cleanup procedures using established helpers

**Risk**: CI/CD integration complexity affecting deployment pipeline
**Mitigation**: Design tests to integrate with existing infrastructure, implement proper timeout handling based on existing patterns, provide clear success/failure criteria

**Risk**: Team knowledge gaps affecting test maintenance
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation following existing patterns, reuse familiar test helpers and structures, implement self-explanatory test names and failure messages
