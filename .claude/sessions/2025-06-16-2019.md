    - Ensure all PRD requirements are documented

### Update - 2025-06-17 6:17 AM

**Summary**: Completed Task 8.5 with comprehensive monitoring fixes and code quality improvements

**Git Changes**:

- No pending changes (all committed)
- Current branch: pedronauck/monitoring (commit: 43f9343)
- Last commit: "feat(task-8.5): enhance monitoring implementation with comprehensive fixes"

**Todo Progress**: 1 completed, 0 in progress, 1 pending

- ✓ Completed: Task 8.5 - Create Comprehensive Integration Tests for Monitoring
- ⏳ Pending: Task 9.0 - Complete Documentation

**Details**:
Successfully completed Task 8.5 following the mandatory task-review.mdc workflow:

**Code Quality Fixes Applied:**

- **HIGH Severity**: Added mutex protection to prevent race conditions in reset functions
- **HIGH Severity**: Fixed callback registration leaks with proper unregistration in temporal.go and system.go
- **HIGH Severity**: Added comprehensive nil guards throughout monitoring package to prevent panics
- **MEDIUM Severity**: Started implementing polling mechanisms to replace time.Sleep in tests

**Technical Achievements:**

- 47/47 monitoring integration tests passing ✅
- 0 linting issues across entire monitoring package ✅
- Enhanced test infrastructure with proper resource cleanup
- Added polling helper functions for more reliable testing
- Fixed bodyclose and noctx linting issues across test suite

**Code Review Process:**

- Followed complete task-review.mdc workflow
- Multi-model code review identified and prioritized issues
- All HIGH severity issues resolved before commit
- Pre-commit validation completed (make fmt && make lint && make test)

**Test Coverage:**

- HTTP metrics integration tests with real requests
- Temporal workflow metrics with actual execution
- System health metrics (build info, uptime)
- Prometheus format compliance validation
- Cardinality limits enforcement
- Graceful degradation scenarios
- Resource leak prevention
- Concurrent metric updates thread safety
- Prometheus client compatibility

The monitoring implementation is now production-ready with comprehensive test coverage, robust error handling, and proper resource management. Ready to proceed with Task 9.0 documentation completion.

## Notes

- Task 8.5 successfully completed with comprehensive code review and fixes
- Monitoring implementation now production-ready with robust error handling
- Only Task 9.0 (Documentation) remains for complete PRD implementation
