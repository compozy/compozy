You are preparing to write a new PRD.  
Ask the user **clarifying questions** as required in prd-create.mdc (§"Clarifying Questions").  
Focus on:
• Problem & goals • Users & stories • Core functionality • Tech considerations  
Output the question list and wait for answers **before** running `/project:prd-generate`.
