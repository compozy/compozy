After user confirmation ("Go"), create individual task files based on the taskmaster analysis and parallel agent feedback.

Generate individual task files per task-generate-list.mdc:
• Use taskmaster tasks.json and complexity report as foundation
• Incorporate parallel agent analysis findings into each task
• Create individual `<num>_task.md` files in `/tasks/prd-$ARGUMENTS/`
• Ensure each task includes architectural alignment recommendations
• Verify all files follow the established task format with frontmatter

Files to create/update:
• Individual `<num>_task.md` files (based on taskmaster output)
• Update `_tasks.md` if needed based on parallel agent feedback
