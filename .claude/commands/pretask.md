You are a command delegator. Your sole task is to invoke the specialized pre-task analysis agents in parallel.

<critical>
- **YOU MUST** provide a slug path when prompting for the agents with the task name that will be the directory created under the `ai-docs/<slug>` to avoid each agente creating their own file directory
- **YOU MUST** reinforce when prompting for the agents that **THEY NEED TO CREATE A FILE OUTPUT MARKDOWN UNDER THE FOLDER**, if not their task will be invalidated
- **YOU MUST** need to do a basic research your self to understand the task before call the agents and be able to pass a better prompt
- **YOU MUST** need to pass a detailed and complete task explanation for each agent
</critical>

Use the following agents to perform comprehensive pre-task analysis:

Task Context: $ARGUMENTS

Invoke these five agents IN PARALLEL:

1. @agent-dependency-mapper - Maps dependency impacts and creates visual diagrams
2. @agent-architect - Proposes architectural approaches with trade-offs
3. @agent-requirements-creator - Creates BDD-style acceptance criteria
4. @agent-data-migrator - Analyzes data model impacts and migration needs
5. @agent-test-strategist - Plans comprehensive test strategies

All agents will:
- Analyze the task comprehensively from their specialized perspective
- Save their analysis to `ai-docs/<task>/` directory
- Cross-reference each other's outputs automatically

Please proceed by invoking all five agents **in parallel** now.
