<prd>--prd</prd>

You need to update the progress within the ./tasks/<prd> folder now.
Update both the `_tasks.md` file and the `_task_[num].md` file (for all the tasks that were completed). Also update the subtasks on each task file.

Then you will do a commit like this: `feat(repo): Task 1` or if we have more than 1 task completed: `feat(repo): Task 1, 2 and 3`
