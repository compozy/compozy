# Task 5.0: Implement `process_tools` with concurrent execution

## Overview

Execute tool calls concurrently in `enter_process_tools`, collect results, and emit `tools_executed` with aggregated metadata.

<import>**MUST READ BEFORE STARTING** @.cursor/rules/critical-validation.mdc</import>

<requirements>
- Use current `tool_executor` patterns for concurrency and error handling
- Preserve counters and result packaging
- Ensure context inheritance and structured logs
</requirements>

## Subtasks

- [x] 5.1 Wire `enter_process_tools` to `tool_executor`
- [x] 5.2 Emit `tools_executed` with results metadata
- [x] 5.3 Unit tests for concurrency and error propagation

## Sequencing

- Blocked by: 1.0, 2.0, 4.0
- Unblocks: 6.0
- Parallelizable: Yes

## Implementation Details

Maintain the same retry and parallelization behavior as legacy implementation.

### Relevant Files

- `engine/llm/orchestrator/tool_executor.go`
- `engine/llm/orchestrator/state_machine.go`

### Dependent Files

- `engine/llm/orchestrator/loop_state.go`

## Success Criteria

- Tests assert event emission and concurrency semantics; lints/tests pass
