# Task 6.0: Write Integration Tests and Documentation

## Overview

Create thorough test coverage and clear documentation for the scheduling feature. This ensures reliability through rigorous testing and enables users to successfully adopt the feature through well-written guides and API documentation.

## Subtasks

- [x] 6.1 Create comprehensive integration test suite

    - Set up temporaltest.TestServer for controlled testing environment
    - Test complete feature workflows across multiple components
    - Verify interactions between Schedule Manager, API, and server startup
    - Test system behavior during config reloads and restarts
    - Ensure all components work together correctly

- [x] 6.2 Create integration tests with Temporal

    - Use temporaltest.TestServer for deterministic testing
    - Test full schedule lifecycle: create → execute → update → delete
    - Test reconciliation after server restart
    - Verify API overrides revert after reload
    - Test concurrent operations and race conditions

- [x] 6.3 Implement edge case and time-based tests

    - Test DST transitions with various timezones
    - Test all OverlapPolicy behaviors (skip, buffer, cancel, allow)
    - Test cron expressions at DST boundaries
    - Test schedule with start/end date boundaries
    - Use time-skipping features for fast execution

- [x] 6.4 Write user documentation

    - Create docs/features/scheduled-workflows.md
    - Explain schedule block syntax with examples
    - Document GitOps model and YAML as source of truth
    - Clarify temporary API override behavior
    - Include troubleshooting guide and FAQs

- [x] 6.5 Update API documentation
    - Add OpenAPI/Swagger specs for all endpoints
    - Document request/response schemas
    - Include example requests and responses
    - Document error codes and their meanings
    - Explain security scopes and rate limits

## Implementation Details

Example test structure:

```go
func TestScheduleManager_ReconcileSchedules(t *testing.T) {
    t.Run("Should create new schedules from YAML", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Setup
        mockClient := &MockScheduleClient{}
        manager := NewManager(mockClient, "test-project")

        // Test
        err := manager.ReconcileSchedules(ctx, workflows)

        // Assert
        assert.NoError(t, err)
        assert.Equal(t, 2, mockClient.CreateCallCount())
    })

    t.Run("Should handle DST transitions correctly", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Test spring-forward and fall-back scenarios
    })
}
```

Documentation structure:

1. **Overview** - What scheduled workflows are and why use them
2. **Quick Start** - Simple example to get users started
3. **Configuration Reference** - All schedule fields explained
4. **GitOps Workflow** - How changes propagate from YAML
5. **API Management** - Using REST API for runtime control
6. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

## Success Criteria

- Unit tests achieve >90% coverage with all edge cases
- Integration tests prove reliability of the complete system
- Time-based tests handle DST and timezone complexities
- Documentation is clear enough for new users to succeed
- API documentation enables external integrations
- No flaky tests - all tests are deterministic

<critical>
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
    - Architecture patterns: `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`
    - Go coding standards: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc`
    - Testing requirements: `.cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc`
    - API standards: `.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc`
    - Security & quality: `.cursor/rules/quality-security.mdc`
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test` before completing parent tasks
- **MUST** follow `.cursor/rules/task-review.mdc` workflow for parent tasks

**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
