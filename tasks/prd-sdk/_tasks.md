Notes on sizing:

- S = Small (≤ half-day)
- M = Medium (1–2 days)
- L = Large (3+ days)

## Task Design Rules

- Each parent task is a closed deliverable: independently shippable and reviewable
- Each parent task must include unit test subtasks derived from `_tests.md`
- Each generated `/_task_<num>.md` must contain explicit Deliverables and Tests sections

## Execution Plan

- Critical Path: 01.0 → 02.0 → 03.0 → 04.0/05.0 → 06.0 → 07.0–12.0 → 22.0–25.0 → 13.0–21.0 → 58.0 → 44.0–52.0 → 57.0/59.0/60.0 → 61.0/62.0
- Parallel Track A (after 12.0): 22.0–25.0 + 13.0–21.0
- Parallel Track B (after 12.0): 26.0–30.0 + 31.0–35.0
- Parallel Track C (after 12.0): 36.0–39.0 + 40.0–43.0
- Parallel Track D (after minimum A/B/C coverage): 44.0–52.0
- Parallel Track E: 57.0–59.0, 60.0

Notes

- All runtime code MUST use `logger.FromContext(ctx)` and `config.FromContext(ctx)`
- Run `make fmt && make lint && make test` before marking any task as completed
