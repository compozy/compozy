# Page Outline: SDK Overview
- **Purpose:** Introduce the Compozy Go SDK, highlight value propositions, and position it against YAML workflows. Based on tasks/prd-sdk/01-executive-summary.md §§ "Why an SDK" and "Who It's For" plus tasks/prd-sdk/_docs.md goals.
- **Audience:** Product engineers adopting Compozy, technical decision makers evaluating SDK vs YAML.
- **Prerequisites:** Familiarity with Compozy Core concepts, link out to `../core/overview`.
- **Key Sections:**
  1. Introduction and positioning (value props, release summary).
  2. When to choose SDK vs YAML (decision table referencing 06-migration-guide.md decision matrix).
  3. Capabilities snapshot (30 builders across 16 categories referencing 03-sdk-entities.md summary table).
  4. How the SDK fits in the platform (link to architecture page and Core runtime doc).
  5. Next steps CTA (links to getting-started, migration, entities inventory).
- **Cross-links:** Core overview, API overview (for client interactions), CLI overview (deploying SDK-built projects).
- **Examples Strategy:** No inline code; embed feature summary cards linking to specific examples in `sdk/examples/` from tasks/prd-sdk/05-examples.md.
- **Callouts:** Include release note snippet referencing `_prd.md` milestone, and a “Context-first development” teaser linking to getting-started.
