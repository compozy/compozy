## Problem Statement

### Current State

- Documentation scattered across README files and code comments
- No centralized resource for learning Compozy
- Developers struggle to understand advanced features
- Support team repeatedly answers the same questions
- No clear onboarding path for new users

### User Pain Points

1. **Discovery**: "I don't know what Compozy can do"
2. **Learning Curve**: "The concepts are complex and interconnected"

## Open Questions

### Content Strategy

1. Should we include video tutorials in phase 1?
2. How detailed should enterprise-specific content be?
3. What's the right balance of conceptual vs. practical content?

### Technical Decisions

1. Which documentation framework? (Docusaurus, Nextra, custom?)
2. How to handle versioning for breaking changes?
3. Should we build an API playground or use existing tools?

### Process Questions

1. Who owns ongoing documentation updates?
2. How do we ensure docs stay synchronized with releases?
3. What's the review process for community contributions?
