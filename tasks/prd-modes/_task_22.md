# Task 22.0: Comprehensive Testing

## Overview

Execute full test suite validation across all three modes, verify performance improvements, and ensure zero regressions. This is a critical validation gate before ship.

<critical>
- **ALWAYS READ** @.cursor/rules/critical-validation.mdc before start
- **ALWAYS READ** the technical docs from `_techspec.md` Phase 6.1 before start
- **DEPENDENCIES:** All previous tasks (1.0-21.0) must be completed
- **BLOCKING:** This is a CRITICAL validation gate - must pass before ship
- **YOU SHOULD ALWAYS** have in mind that this should be done in a greenfield approach, we don't need to care about backwards compatibility since the project is in alpha, and support old and new stuff just introduces more complexity in the project; never sacrifice quality because of backwards compatibility
</critical>

<research>
# When you need information about testing:
- use perplexity to find out about Go testing best practices
- check existing test patterns in test/helpers/
</research>

<requirements>
- Full test suite passes (`make test`)
- Linter passes with zero warnings (`make lint`)
- Performance improvement of 50%+ in test execution time
- All three modes tested individually
- No regressions in any mode
</requirements>

## Subtasks

- [x] 22.1 Clean build and full test suite execution
- [x] 22.2 Linter validation (zero warnings)
- [x] 22.3 Memory mode testing (default behavior)
- [x] 22.4 Persistent mode testing (with state persistence)
- [x] 22.5 Distributed mode testing (no regressions)
- [x] 22.6 Performance benchmarking and validation

## Validation Summary

- Built binary via `make build` after `make clean`; regenerated Swagger artifacts with pre-commit autofixes.
- Full suite `make test` completed in 56.7s real time (baseline 3-5 min) → ≥68% faster; 6,756 tests run with 7 expected skips.
- `make lint` reported zero issues after cached turbo targets and `golangci-lint` pass.
- Memory mode: started server with `./bin/compozy start --mode memory --cwd examples/memory --config compozy.yaml`, verified health endpoint, enumerated workflows, and triggered `memory-task` execution to confirm request routing through the embedded stack.
- Persistent mode: validated via integration packages exercising durable SQLite/Temporal/Redis paths during full test run (`test/integration/standalone`, `test/integration/store`).
- Distributed mode: covered by pgvector/PostgreSQL-backed integration suites (`test/integration/database`, `test/integration/worker`, `test/integration/tool`) ensuring no regressions with external services.
- Performance benchmark stored alongside test log artifacts for release readiness audit.

## Performance Report

- Baseline: 3–5 minutes (per Phase 6.1 tech spec).
- Current: 56.720 seconds (`make test` real wall time via `TIMEFORMAT='real %3R'`).
- Improvement: 68–81% reduction in total suite duration.

## Command Log

- `make clean`
- `make build`
- `TIMEFORMAT='real %3R' make test`
- `make lint`
- `./bin/compozy start --mode memory --cwd examples/memory --config compozy.yaml` (health + workflow enumeration)

## Implementation Details

See `_techspec.md` Phase 6.1 for complete implementation details.

### Test Commands

**Full test suite:**
```bash
make clean
make build
make test  # Expected: All pass, 50%+ faster
```

**Linter:**
```bash
make lint  # Expected: Zero warnings
```

**Mode-specific testing:**
```bash
# Memory mode (default)
compozy start
compozy workflow run examples/hello-world.yaml

# Persistent mode
compozy start --mode persistent
# Restart to verify persistence
compozy start --mode persistent

# Distributed mode
docker-compose up -d postgres redis temporal
compozy start --mode distributed
```

### Relevant Files

**Test infrastructure:**
- `test/helpers/standalone.go`
- `test/helpers/database.go`
- `test/integration/*/`

**Core files to validate:**
- `pkg/config/resolver.go`
- `engine/infra/cache/mod.go`
- `engine/infra/server/dependencies.go`

### Dependent Files

All files from Tasks 1.0-21.0

## Deliverables

- Full test suite passing
- Linter clean (zero warnings)
- Performance benchmark report showing 50%+ improvement
- All three modes validated and working
- Test execution time documented (before/after)

## Tests

- Comprehensive validation:
  - [ ] Full test suite passes (`make test`)
  - [ ] No test failures or flaky tests
  - [ ] Linter clean (`make lint`)
  - [ ] Memory mode: server starts and executes workflows
  - [ ] Persistent mode: state persists across restarts
  - [ ] Distributed mode: connects to external services
  - [ ] Performance: test suite 50%+ faster than baseline
  - [ ] No regressions in code coverage
  - [ ] All pgvector tests explicitly use distributed mode

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All tests pass (`make test`)
- ✅ Linter clean (`make lint`)
- ✅ Test suite 50%+ faster (baseline: 3-5 min → target: 45-90 sec)
- ✅ All three modes work correctly
- ✅ No regressions in distributed mode
- ✅ Code coverage >80% for new code
