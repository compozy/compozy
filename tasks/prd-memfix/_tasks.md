# Memory Task Integration Fix Implementation Task Summary

## Relevant Files

### Core Implementation Files

- `engine/task2/factory.go` - Task2 factory requiring memory task support
- `engine/task/activities/exec_memory.go` - Memory task execution activity
- `engine/task/uc/exec_memory_operation.go` - Memory operation use cases
- `engine/memory/manager.go` - Memory manager implementation
- `engine/worker/mod.go` - Worker setup and memory manager initialization

### Integration Points

- `engine/task2/basic/normalizer.go` - Basic normalizer to reuse for memory tasks
- `engine/task2/basic/response_handler.go` - Basic response handler to reuse
- `engine/task2/shared/` - Shared contracts and interfaces

### Test Files

- `engine/task2/factory_test.go` - Factory tests requiring memory task cases
- `engine/task/activities/exec_memory_test.go` - Memory activity tests
- `test/integration/memory/` - Memory integration tests

### Documentation Files

- `docs/features/memory-tasks.md` - Memory task usage documentation
- `docs/configuration/memory-resources.md` - Memory resource configuration

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the implementation files (e.g., `factory.go` and `factory_test.go` in the same directory)
- Use `go test ./...` to run all tests or `go test -v ./path/to/package` for specific package tests
- Always run `make fmt && make lint && make test` before committing changes
- Follow project testing standards with `t.Run("Should...")` pattern
