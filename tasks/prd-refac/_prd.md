# Product Requirements Document: Normalizer Package Refactoring

## Project Overview

The normalizer package is a critical component of the Compozy workflow orchestration engine that handles configuration normalization, template processing, and environment merging. Currently implemented as a monolithic package, it requires refactoring to improve maintainability, extensibility, and adherence to architectural standards.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues

1. **Maintenance Burden**: The monolithic normalizer package has become difficult to maintain as new task types are added
2. **Extensibility Challenges**: Adding new task types requires modifying core normalizer logic, violating the Open/Closed Principle
3. **Testing Complexity**: The tight coupling makes it difficult to test task-specific logic in isolation
4. **Code Organization**: Inconsistent patterns across different task types lead to confusion and slower development
5. **Technical Debt**: The current implementation violates SOLID principles, creating long-term maintainability issues

### Impact

- **Development Velocity**: New features take longer to implement due to code complexity
- **Bug Risk**: Changes to support one task type risk breaking others
- **Onboarding**: New developers struggle to understand the normalization flow
- **Quality**: Difficult to achieve comprehensive test coverage

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Improve Maintainability**: Create a modular architecture where each task type has its own normalizer
2. **Enable Extensibility**: Make it easy to add new task types without modifying existing code
3. **Enhance Testability**: Allow each normalizer to be tested in isolation
4. **Standardize Patterns**: Establish consistent patterns across all task types

### Success Metrics

- **Code Quality**: Achieve 80%+ test coverage on normalization logic
- **Development Speed**: Reduce time to add new task types by 50%
- **Bug Reduction**: Decrease normalization-related bugs by 40%
- **Performance**: Maintain or improve current performance benchmarks

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Task-Specific Normalization**

    - Each task type must have its own dedicated normalizer
    - Support for: basic, parallel, collection, router, wait, aggregate, composite, signal

2. **Component Normalization**

    - Separate normalizers for agent and tool components
    - Maintain environment merging hierarchy (workflow → task → component)

3. **Transition Handling**

    - Support success and error transition normalization
    - Preserve output transformation capabilities

4. **Template Processing**

    - Maintain current template engine integration
    - Support all existing template syntax and features

5. **Context Building**
    - Preserve sophisticated context building with parent/child relationships
    - Maintain workflow state access and task output aggregation

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**

    - No degradation in normalization speed
    - Minimize memory allocations
    - Support concurrent normalization where applicable

2. **Compatibility**

    - Since we're in active development, breaking changes are acceptable
    - Focus on the best architecture rather than backward compatibility

3. **Extensibility**

    - New task types should be addable without core changes
    - Plugin architecture considerations for future

4. **Maintainability**
    - Clear separation of concerns
    - Comprehensive documentation
    - Consistent coding patterns

## User Stories

### Developer Experience

1. **As a developer**, I want to add a new task type without modifying core normalizer code, so that I can extend the system safely

2. **As a developer**, I want to understand how a specific task type is normalized by looking at a single file, so that I can debug issues quickly

3. **As a developer**, I want to test task normalization logic in isolation, so that I can ensure correctness without complex setup

### System Behavior

4. **As the system**, I need to normalize task configurations based on their type, so that templates are processed correctly

5. **As the system**, I need to merge environments hierarchically, so that configuration inheritance works properly

6. **As the system**, I need to build rich contexts for template processing, so that all necessary data is available

## Scope

### In Scope

- Refactoring existing normalizer package to task2 architecture
- Creating task-specific normalizer implementations
- Establishing factory pattern for normalizer creation
- Moving shared components to appropriate packages
- Comprehensive testing of new architecture
- Migration strategy and implementation

### Out of Scope

- Changing template syntax or processing logic
- Modifying task configuration schemas
- Altering environment merging behavior
- Performance optimizations beyond current capability
- UI/API changes (this is internal refactoring)

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Regression Risk**

    - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite comparing old vs new behavior

2. **Performance Risk**

    - **Mitigation**: Benchmark at each phase, optimize hot paths

3. **Integration Risk**
    - **Mitigation**: Feature flag for gradual rollout

### Project Risks

1. **Scope Creep**

    - **Mitigation**: Clear boundaries, focus on refactoring only

2. **Timeline Risk**
    - **Mitigation**: Phased approach, deliver incrementally
