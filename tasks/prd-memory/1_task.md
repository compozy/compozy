# Task 1.0: Implement Enhanced Memory Domain Foundation

## Overview

Create the core memory interfaces, data models, and Redis-backed storage with async operations support. This establishes the foundation for the entire memory system with enhanced features including priority management, hybrid flushing, and distributed locking capabilities.

## Subtasks

- [ ] 1.1 Define Memory, MemoryStore, and DistributedLock interfaces with async operations
- [ ] 1.2 Implement MemoryResource, PriorityBlock, TokenAllocation, and FlushingStrategy data models
- [ ] 1.3 Create redisStore with async methods (AppendMessageAsync, ReadMessagesAsync, etc.)
- [ ] 1.4 Implement redisDistributedLock using SET NX EX pattern with automatic refresh
- [ ] 1.5 Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for all interfaces

## Implementation Details

Define the core `Memory` interface with async operations as the primary interface:

```go
type Memory interface {
    AppendAsync(ctx context.Context, msg llm.Message) error
    ReadAsync(ctx context.Context) ([]llm.Message, error)
    LenAsync(ctx context.Context) (int, error)
    GetTokenCountAsync(ctx context.Context) (int, error)
    GetMemoryHealthAsync(ctx context.Context) (*MemoryHealth, error)
}
```

Implement MemoryStore interface for persistence-agnostic operations and DistributedLock for cluster-safe operations. Create enhanced data models supporting priority blocks, token allocation ratios, and flushing strategies.

Use existing Redis pool from `engine/infra/store` with `memory:` namespace prefix. Implement Redis distributed locking using `SET NX EX` pattern with automatic refresh mechanism for long operations.

## Success Criteria

- All core interfaces defined with async operations support
- Enhanced data models support priority management and hybrid flushing
- Redis store implementation with distributed locking capability
- Unit tests with in-memory fake implementations achieve >85% coverage
- Integration tests with Redis validate concurrent access patterns
- Lock acquire/release/refresh cycles work correctly under load

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
    - Architecture patterns: `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`
    - Go coding standards: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc`
    - Testing requirements: `.cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc`
    - API standards: `.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc`
    - Security & quality: `.cursor/rules/quality-security.mdc`
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test` before completing parent tasks
- **MUST** follow `.cursor/rules/task-review.mdc` workflow for parent tasks

**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
