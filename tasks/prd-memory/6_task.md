# Task 6.0: Implement Async-Safe Memory Instance Management

## Overview

Create thread-safe memory instances with distributed locking and async operations. This system orchestrates all memory features (priorities, flushing, locking) into a cohesive async-safe interface that supports concurrent agent access while maintaining data consistency.

## Subtasks

- [ ] 6.1 Build AsyncSafeMemoryInstance wrapping memory operations with distributed locking
- [ ] 6.2 Implement withLockRefresh for automatic TTL extension during long operations
- [ ] 6.3 Create performFlushAsync combining priority eviction and hybrid flushing
- [ ] 6.4 Add optimized AppendAsync with count-based flush checking
- [ ] 6.5 Implement diagnostic methods and MemoryHealth reporting

## Implementation Details

Build `AsyncSafeMemoryInstance` as the orchestrating component that combines:

- Distributed locking for cluster-safe operations
- Priority-based token management (from Task 2)
- Hybrid flushing strategy (from Task 3)
- Optimized flush checking using message counts

Key features:

- `AppendAsync()` with distributed locking and automatic flush checking
- `withLockRefresh()` spawning goroutines for lock TTL extension
- `performFlushAsync()` integrating priority eviction + hybrid flushing
- Lock refresh mechanism with 15s intervals for 30s TTL locks
- Memory key template evaluation using tplengine
- `MemoryHealth` diagnostics with priority breakdown and flush metrics

The system must handle long operations gracefully with automatic lock refresh while maintaining optimal performance through count-based flush triggers.

## Success Criteria

- Async-safe operations work correctly under concurrent access patterns
- Distributed locking prevents data loss during multi-agent scenarios
- Lock refresh mechanism extends TTL automatically for long operations
- Priority eviction and hybrid flushing integrate seamlessly
- Optimized flush checking avoids performance bottlenecks
- Memory health reporting provides accurate diagnostic information
- Template evaluation works with all workflow context variables

<critical>
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
    - Architecture patterns: `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`
    - Go coding standards: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc`
    - Testing requirements: `.cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc`
    - API standards: `.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc`
    - Security & quality: `.cursor/rules/quality-security.mdc`
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test` before completing parent tasks
- **MUST** follow `.cursor/rules/task-review.mdc` workflow for parent tasks

**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
