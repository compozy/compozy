### Existing Infrastructure to Extend

- `engine/infra/cache/redis.go` - Extend RedisInterface with memory-specific operations
- `engine/infra/cache/lock_manager.go` - Use existing distributed locking with Lua scripts

### Test Files

- `engine/memory/interfaces_test.go` - Interface tests with in-memory fakes
- `engine/memory/token_manager_test.go` - Token allocation and FIFO eviction tests
- `engine/memory/flush_strategy_test.go` - Hybrid flushing and summarization tests
- `engine/memory/instance_test.go` - Async-safe operations and locking tests
- `engine/memory/manager_test.go` - Template evaluation and lifecycle tests
- `engine/memory/config_resolver_test.go` - Configuration resolution tests
- `engine/memory/lifecycle_test.go` - Lifecycle management tests
- `engine/memory/cleanup_test.go` - Cleanup mechanism tests
- `engine/memory/activities/flush_test.go` - Temporal activity tests
- `test/integration/memory/redis_test.go` - Redis integration tests
- `test/integration/memory/end_to_end_test.go` - Full workflow tests
- `test/integration/memory/cleanup_test.go` - Integration tests for cleanup

### Configuration Files

- `memories/customer-support.yaml` - Example memory resource file
- `cluster/grafana/dashboards/memory-monitoring.json` - Grafana dashboard

### Documentation Files

- `docs/memory-system.md` - Developer documentation
- `docs/memory-migration.md` - Migration guide
- `examples/memory-sharing/` - End-to-end examples

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the implementation files (e.g., `memory.go` and `memory_test.go` in the same directory)
- Use `go test ./...` to run all tests or `go test -v ./engine/memory` for memory package tests
- Integration tests require Redis and use build tag `integration`
- Always run `make fmt && make lint && make test` before committing changes
- Follow project testing standards with `t.Run("Should...")` pattern
- Reuse existing infrastructure (Redis client, LockManager) instead of creating new implementations
- Use Temporal activities for background processing instead of external libraries like asynq
