- **Error Handling**: Consistent structured error types throughout
- **Import Management**: Clean dependency graph without cycles

## ⚠️ Critical Production Readiness Gaps

### Priority 1: Deployment Blockers (MUST FIX)

#### 2. Incomplete Core Implementation ❌

- **Issue**: builder.go:149 returns "instance implementation not yet migrated"
- **Impact**: Core functionality broken
- **Risk**: Instance creation fails in production
- **Required**: Complete instance implementation

#### 3. File Size Violations ❌

- **manager.go**: 612 lines (>500 limit)
- **store/redis.go**: 608 lines (>500 limit)
- **metrics.go**: 557 lines (>500 limit)
- **Impact**: Violates project coding standards

#### 1. Test Coverage Catastrophe ❌

- **Current**: 15.1% coverage
- **Target**: >90% minimum (>80% acceptable)
- **Impact**: Unacceptable regression risk
- **Evidence**: coverage.out shows extensive 0-hit lines across all packages

### Priority 2: Code Quality Issues (HIGH)

#### 1. Oversized Functions ⚠️

- **Count**: 8 functions exceed 50-line limit
- **Examples**:
    - activities/flush.go:FlushMemory (84 lines)
    - flush_strategy.go:FlushMessages (69 lines)
- **Required**: Extract method refactoring

#### 2. Technical Debt ⚠️

- **TODO/FIXME Markers**: 7 files contain incomplete work indicators
- **Missing Tests**: Critical components lack test coverage
- **Documentation**: Several components need documentation updates

### Priority 3: Enhancement Opportunities (MEDIUM)

#### 1. Missing Test Files

- manager_test.go
- flush_strategy_test.go
- health_service_test.go
- metrics_test.go

#### 2. Performance Validation

- Benchmarks for refactored components
- Integration tests for external compatibility
- Load testing for Redis operations

## 🚀 Success Criteria for Completion

### Definition of Done

1. ✅ All tests pass with >80% coverage
2. ✅ Instance builder creates working instances
3. ✅ All files under 500 lines, functions under 50 lines
4. ✅ Zero TODO/FIXME markers remain
5. ✅ External integrations (task, worker packages) function correctly

### Deployment Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Critical: Test coverage >80%
- [ ] Critical: Instance implementation complete
- [ ] Critical: All files <500 lines
- [ ] High: All functions <50 lines

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Before Refactoring

- 1 monolithic 1094-line file
- 1 interface with 20+ methods
- 1 critical ReDoS vulnerability
- Difficult maintenance and testing

### After Refactoring (Target)
