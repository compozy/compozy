# Task 8.0: Integrate Enhanced Memory System with Agent Runtime

## Overview

Update agent configuration and runtime to support the new memory system with async operations. This integration enables agents to use the enhanced memory features through the three-tier configuration system while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Subtasks

- [ ] 8.1 Extend agent router to resolve enhanced memory configurations
- [ ] 8.2 Update agent constructor to accept memory references and validate configurations
- [ ] 8.3 Create agent memory adapter for dependency injection into LLM orchestrator
- [ ] 8.4 Add support for multiple memory references per agent with different access modes
- [ ] 8.5 Implement configuration migration logic for backward compatibility

## Implementation Details

Extend the agent router to use `ConfigurationResolver` for parsing all three memory configuration levels. Update agent constructor to accept resolved memory references and validate configurations at startup.

Create an agent memory adapter that bridges between agent configuration and the LLM orchestrator, providing resolved `Memory` interfaces via dependency injection.

Support agents with:

- No memory references (stateless agents)
- Single memory reference (Level 1)
- Multiple memories with shared template (Level 2)
- Multiple memories with individual configuration (Level 3)

Implement configuration migration logic to ensure existing agent configurations continue working while new configurations use enhanced features.

## Success Criteria

- Agent configuration resolution works for all three complexity levels
- Memory references validate correctly at agent startup
- Multiple memory instances per agent work with different access modes
- Dependency injection provides Memory interfaces to LLM orchestrator
- Configuration migration maintains backward compatibility
- Error propagation from memory operations works correctly

<critical>
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
    - Architecture patterns: `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`
    - Go coding standards: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc`
    - Testing requirements: `.cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc`
    - API standards: `.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc`
    - Security & quality: `.cursor/rules/quality-security.mdc`
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test` before completing parent tasks
- **MUST** follow `.cursor/rules/task-review.mdc` workflow for parent tasks

**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
