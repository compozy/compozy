# Task 3.0: Implement Hybrid Flushing Strategy with Rule-Based Summarization

## Overview

Create intelligent memory management with deterministic summarization for context continuity. This system maintains conversation flow while effectively managing token budgets through rule-based summarization that ensures predictable costs and performance.

## Subtasks

- [ ] 3.1 Build HybridFlushingStrategy with ShouldFlush and FlushMessages methods
- [ ] 3.2 Implement RuleBasedSummarizer combining first and N recent messages
- [ ] 3.3 Add optimized flush checking using message count estimates
- [ ] 3.4 Create FlushResult structure with summarization metrics
- [ ] 3.5 Support configurable summarization parameters and token savings calculation

## Implementation Details

Implement `HybridFlushingStrategy` as the default flushing approach using rule-based summarization for v1. The strategy combines first message and N most recent messages to form summaries, providing context continuity while avoiding LLM costs.

Key components:

- `ShouldFlush()` with optimized checking using count estimates to avoid performance bottlenecks
- `FlushMessages()` that summarizes oldest X% of messages and preserves recent context
- `RuleBasedSummarizer` with deterministic message combination (first + last N messages)
- Configurable parameters: trigger thresholds, summary size, oldest percent to summarize
- Token savings calculation and summary preservation in memory

The system must implement optimized flush checking using message count-based triggers to avoid expensive token counting on every append operation.

## Success Criteria

- Hybrid flushing maintains context continuity through intelligent summarization
- Rule-based summarization provides deterministic, cost-effective context preservation
- Optimized flush checking avoids performance bottlenecks on high-volume scenarios
- Summary quality preserves essential context (first + recent messages)
- Token savings calculations accurately reflect flush effectiveness
- Configurable parameters allow tuning for different conversation patterns

<critical>
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
    - Architecture patterns: `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`
    - Go coding standards: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc`
    - Testing requirements: `.cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc`
    - API standards: `.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc`
    - Security & quality: `.cursor/rules/quality-security.mdc`
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test` before completing parent tasks
- **MUST** follow `.cursor/rules/task-review.mdc` workflow for parent tasks

**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
