# Memory as a Shared Resource - Implementation Tasks

This directory contains the complete task breakdown for implementing Memory as a Shared Resource feature in Compozy. The tasks are organized in sequential phases to support the established development workflow.

## Task Overview

**Total Tasks**: 45 (10 parent tasks + 35 subtasks)  
**Estimated Duration**: 6-7 weeks  
**Complexity Distribution**: 5 high complexity (7-10), 4 medium (4-6), 36 low (1-3)

## Parent Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

- **Task 1.0**: Enhanced Memory Domain Foundation with Async Operations
- **Task 2.0**: Redis-Based Memory Store with Distributed Locking Implementation
- **Task 4.0**: Enhanced Three-Tier Agent Memory Configuration Resolution

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Weeks 2-3)

- **Task 3.0**: Token Management and Hybrid Flushing Implementation
- **Task 5.0**: Memory Manager with Async-Safe Instance Management
- **Task 13.0**: Implement Priority-Based Token Eviction

### Phase 3: Integration (Weeks 3-4)

- **Task 6.0**: Agent Runtime and LLM Orchestrator Memory Integration
- **Task 7.0**: Advanced Features and Performance Optimization
- **Task 14.0**: Implement Memory Resource Cleanup

### Phase 4: Quality & Polish (Weeks 4-5)

- **Task 8.0**: End-to-End Testing and Comprehensive Documentation

## Key Features Implemented

### Enhanced Developer Experience

- **Level 1**: Ultra-simple single memory reference (`memory: "id"`)
- **Level 2**: Simple multi-memory with shared template (`memory: true + memories: [...]`)
- **Level 3**: Full control with per-memory configuration (`memories: [{id, mode, key}]`)

### Advanced Memory Management

- **Token-based memory management** with FIFO eviction strategy
- **Priority-based token eviction** for preserving critical content during token pressure
- **Hybrid flushing strategy** with rule-based summarization for context continuity
- **Token allocation ratios** for budget distribution (system, short_term, long_term)
- **Async-first operations** with distributed Redis locking for cluster safety
- **Active memory cleanup** on workflow termination with TTL-based fallback

### Production Features

- **Multi-tenant key sanitization** with automatic namespacing
- **Circuit breaker patterns** for Redis resilience
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with Prometheus metrics
- **Performance optimization** targeting <50ms overhead for memory operations

## Critical Path Dependencies

1. **Task 1.0** → Memory interfaces enable all subsequent development
2. **Task 2.0** → Redis implementation required for persistence and locking
3. **Task 3.0** → Token management and flushing features integrate into memory operations
4. **Task 13.0** → Priority-based eviction builds on token management
5. **Task 5.0** → Memory manager orchestrates all features for runtime usage
6. **Task 6.0** → Agent integration validates end-to-end functionality
7. **Task 14.0** → Cleanup mechanisms ensure proper resource management

## Configuration Examples

### Level 1: Ultra-Simple

```yaml
agents:
    - id: simple-agent
      memory: customer-support-context
      memory_key: "support-{{ .workflow.input.conversationId }}"
```

### Level 2: Multi-Memory

```yaml
agents:
    - id: multi-agent
      memory: true
      memories: [customer-support-context, user-preferences]
      memory_key: "support-{{ .workflow.input.conversationId }}"
```

### Level 3: Advanced

```yaml
agents:
    - id: advanced-agent
      memories:
          - id: customer-support-context
            mode: read-write
            key: "support-{{ .workflow.input.conversationId }}"
          - id: user-preferences
            mode: read-only
            key: "prefs-{{ .workflow.input.userId }}"
```

## Quality Standards

All tasks follow established Compozy development standards:

- **Testing**: `t.Run("Should...")` pattern with >85% coverage
- **Code Review**: Mandatory Zen MCP validation before completion
- **Performance**: <50ms overhead, <10MB per memory instance
- **Quality Gates**: `make lint && make test` validation for all tasks

## Getting Started

1. Review the PRD (`_prd.md`) and Technical Specification (`_techspec.md`)
2. Start with Task 1.0 to establish domain foundation
3. Follow dependency chain through each phase
4. Use Zen MCP tools for code review validation
5. Complete comprehensive testing in Task 8.0

Each task file contains detailed implementation steps, acceptance criteria, and testing requirements to support the sequential development workflow.
