# Task 12.0: Create Documentation, Examples, and Performance Testing

## Overview

Develop comprehensive documentation, usage examples, and performance validation for the memory system. This ensures developers can effectively adopt and use the enhanced memory features while meeting performance requirements.

## Subtasks

- [ ] 12.1 Create developer documentation for all three configuration levels
- [ ] 12.2 Build end-to-end workflow examples demonstrating memory sharing
- [ ] 12.3 Document memory key template variables and sanitization rules
- [ ] 12.4 Create performance benchmarking suite for async operations
- [ ] 12.5 Add migration guide and troubleshooting documentation

## Implementation Details

Create comprehensive developer documentation covering:

**Configuration Levels**: Complete examples for Level 1 (simple), Level 2 (multi-memory), Level 3 (advanced)
**Memory Sharing**: End-to-end workflows showing agent memory sharing patterns
**Template Variables**: Full documentation of workflow context variables and evaluation
**Key Sanitization**: Rules for Redis compatibility and multi-tenant safety
**Performance**: Benchmarking suite validating <50ms latency requirements

Build practical examples:

- Customer support workflow with intake/resolution agents sharing context
- Research workflow with multiple agents accessing shared findings
- User preference management across different conversation types

Include migration guide from stateless to memory-enabled agents, troubleshooting guide for common configuration issues, and best practices for memory resource design.

## Success Criteria

- Documentation examples work correctly for all configuration complexity levels
- End-to-end examples demonstrate practical memory sharing use cases
- Performance benchmarks validate <50ms latency and <10MB memory requirements
- Migration guide enables smooth transition from stateless configurations
- Troubleshooting guide addresses common configuration and runtime issues
- Best practices documentation helps developers design effective memory resources

<critical>
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
    - Architecture patterns: `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`
    - Go coding standards: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc`
    - Testing requirements: `.cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc`
    - API standards: `.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc`
    - Security & quality: `.cursor/rules/quality-security.mdc`
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test` before completing parent tasks
- **MUST** follow `.cursor/rules/task-review.mdc` workflow for parent tasks

**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
