# Task 11.0: Add Monitoring, Metrics, and Observability

## Overview

Implement comprehensive monitoring for memory operations, performance, and health. This system provides visibility into memory usage patterns, performance characteristics, and operational health for production deployments.

## Subtasks

- [ ] 11.1 Add Prometheus metrics for memory operations and performance
- [ ] 11.2 Implement structured logging with async operation tracing
- [ ] 11.3 Create Grafana dashboard for memory visualization
- [ ] 11.4 Add health check endpoints for memory system status
- [ ] 11.5 Create alerting rules for memory system health

## Implementation Details

Add comprehensive Prometheus metrics including:

- `memory_messages_total{memory_id, priority}` – messages by priority level
- `memory_trim_total{memory_id, strategy}` – trim operations by strategy
- `memory_flush_total{memory_id, type}` – flush operations (summary/eviction)
- `memory_operation_latency_seconds{operation, memory_id}` – async operation latency
- `memory_lock_acquire_total{memory_id}` – distributed lock acquisitions
- `memory_lock_contention_total{memory_id}` – lock failures/retries
- `memory_tokens_saved_total{memory_id, strategy}` – tokens saved through flushing
- `memory_priority_distribution{memory_id, priority}` – message distribution
- `memory_config_resolution_total{pattern}` – configuration pattern usage

Implement structured logging via `pkg/logger` with async operation tracing. Create enhanced Grafana dashboard with priority and flushing visualizations.

## Success Criteria

- Prometheus metrics collection provides comprehensive memory system visibility
- Structured logging enables async operation tracing and debugging
- Grafana dashboard visualizes memory health, performance, and usage patterns
- Health check endpoints report memory system status accurately
- Metrics collection accuracy validated under various load scenarios
- Dashboard functionality supports operational monitoring and alerting

<critical>
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
    - Architecture patterns: `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`
    - Go coding standards: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc`
    - Testing requirements: `.cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc`
    - API standards: `.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc`
    - Security & quality: `.cursor/rules/quality-security.mdc`
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test` before completing parent tasks
- **MUST** follow `.cursor/rules/task-review.mdc` workflow for parent tasks

**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
