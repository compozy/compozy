# Task 10.0: Implement Privacy Controls and Data Protection

## Overview

Add privacy flags, redaction policies, and selective persistence controls for sensitive data. This system ensures compliance with privacy regulations while protecting sensitive information in conversation memory.

## Subtasks

- [ ] 10.1 Implement message-level privacy flags for non-persistable content
- [ ] 10.2 Add synchronous redaction before data leaves process boundaries
- [ ] 10.3 Create privacy policy configuration at memory resource level
- [ ] 10.4 Implement selective persistence controls that honor privacy flags
- [ ] 10.5 Add logging when sensitive data is excluded from persistence

## Implementation Details

Implement privacy controls that work seamlessly with async memory operations:

**Message-level privacy flags**: Extend message structure to include privacy metadata
**Synchronous redaction**: Apply configurable regex patterns before persistence
**Privacy policies**: Configure redaction rules at memory resource level
**Selective persistence**: Honor privacy flags in Redis storage layer
**Privacy logging**: Log when sensitive data is excluded for audit purposes

Support configurable redaction patterns:

- SSN: `\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b`
- Credit cards: `\b\d{4}-\d{4}-\d{4}-\d{4}\b`
- Custom patterns defined per memory resource

Ensure privacy controls integrate with async operations without performance impact.

## Success Criteria

- Message-level privacy flags prevent sensitive data persistence
- Regex redaction patterns work accurately with configurable rules
- Privacy policies configure correctly at memory resource level
- Selective persistence honors privacy flags in Redis layer
- Privacy exclusion logging provides audit trail for compliance
- Privacy controls work seamlessly with async memory operations
- Performance impact of privacy processing remains minimal

<critical>
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
    - Architecture patterns: `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`
    - Go coding standards: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc`
    - Testing requirements: `.cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc`
    - API standards: `.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc`
    - Security & quality: `.cursor/rules/quality-security.mdc`
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test` before completing parent tasks
- **MUST** follow `.cursor/rules/task-review.mdc` workflow for parent tasks

**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
