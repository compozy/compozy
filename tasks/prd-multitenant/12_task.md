# Task 12.0: Security Audit and Performance Optimization

## Overview

Conduct comprehensive security audit, implement performance optimizations, and validate multi-tenant isolation. This final task ensures the system meets all security and performance requirements.

## Subtasks

- [ ] 12.1 Conduct security audit focusing on cross-organization data leakage prevention
- [ ] 12.2 Perform penetration testing for authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] 12.3 Execute performance benchmarking with organization-filtered queries
- [ ] 12.4 Analyze database query optimization and index usage
- [ ] 12.5 Test rate limiting effectiveness under realistic load conditions
- [ ] 12.6 Validate API key security against timing attacks and entropy analysis
- [ ] 12.7 Implement comprehensive audit logging for security events
- [ ] 12.8 Conduct load testing with multiple organizations and concurrent users

## Implementation Details

Security and performance validation:

1. **Security audit** focusing on cross-organization data leakage prevention
2. **Penetration testing** for authentication bypass attempts
3. **Performance benchmarking** with organization-filtered queries
4. **Database query optimization** and index usage analysis
5. **Rate limiting effectiveness** testing under load
6. **API key security validation** (timing attacks, entropy)
7. **Audit logging implementation** for security events
8. **Load testing** with multiple organizations and concurrent users

Target metrics: <50ms auth latency, <200ms API response time, 0 cross-org data leakage.

## Success Criteria

- Security audit confirms zero cross-organization data leakage
- Penetration testing reveals no authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks meet target metrics for auth and API response times
- Database queries optimized with proper index usage
- Rate limiting effectively prevents abuse under load
- API key security validated against timing attacks with sufficient entropy
- Audit logging captures all security-relevant events
- Load testing demonstrates system stability with concurrent multi-tenant usage

<critical>
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
    - Architecture patterns: `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`
    - Go coding standards: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc`
    - Testing requirements: `.cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc`
    - API standards: `.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc`
    - Security & quality: `.cursor/rules/quality-security.mdc`
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test` before completing ANY subtask
- **MUST** follow `.cursor/rules/task-completion.mdc` workflow for parent tasks
**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
