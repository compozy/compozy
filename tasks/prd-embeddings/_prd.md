# Product Requirements Document: Document Embeddings for Agent Knowledge

## Overview

Compozy agents currently lack access to organization-specific knowledge beyond their training data and immediate workflow context. This creates a significant barrier to agent effectiveness, forcing users to manually provide context repeatedly or limiting agent utility to generic tasks.

**Document Embeddings** will enable users to upload organizational documents (technical documentation, policies, codebases, etc.) that agents can automatically reference during workflow execution. By implementing vector-based document storage and retrieval, agents will gain persistent access to domain-specific knowledge, dramatically improving their performance on specialized tasks.

**Target Users:** Software development teams, technical writers, business analysts, and compliance officers using Compozy for domain-specific workflows

**Value Proposition:** Transform agents from generic assistants to domain-aware specialists, reducing manual context sharing by 40% while enabling entirely new use cases requiring specialized knowledge.

## Goals

### Primary Objectives

- **Reduce Manual Context Input:** Achieve 40% reduction in manual context provision for repeat workflows within 6 months
- **Enable Domain Specialization:** Support agents in accessing organization-specific technical documentation, policies, and codebases
- **User Adoption:** Reach 80% adoption among active workspaces (upload ≥1 document AND reference ≥1x) within 6 months of MVP

## User Stories

### Primary Personas

**Software Developer (Alex)**

- As a developer, I want to upload API documentation so that agents can automatically reference correct endpoints and parameters during code generation workflows
- As a team lead, I want to upload architectural decisions so that agents help new developers understand system design patterns
- As a developer, I want agents to reference internal code standards so that generated code follows our organization's conventions

**Business Analyst (Morgan)**

- As a business analyst, I want to upload compliance policies so that workflow agents ensure all processes meet regulatory requirements
- As a process owner, I want to upload SOP documents so that agents can guide team members through standardized procedures
- As a compliance officer, I want to audit which documents agents accessed during sensitive workflows

**Technical Writer (Jordan)**

- As a technical writer, I want to upload documentation drafts so that agents can help maintain consistency across related documents
- As a knowledge manager, I want to organize documents hierarchically so that agents can find contextually relevant information
- As a content strategist, I want to update documentation and have agents immediately reference the latest versions

### Edge Cases & Error Scenarios

- User uploads corrupted or unreadable files → System provides clear error messaging and format guidance
- Document exceeds size limits → Progressive upload with chunking or clear limit communication
- Multiple document versions exist → Agent references most recent with option to specify version
- Access permissions conflict → Clear authorization errors with resolution guidance
- Non-English documents → System handles multilingual content with appropriate embedding models

## Core Features

### FR-1: Document Upload & Storage

The system must support document upload via CLI interface with the following capabilities:

- File format support: PDF, Markdown (.md), plain text (.txt), common code files (.js, .py, .go, .java, .ts)
- Maximum file size: 50MB per document
- Storage limit: 1GB total per workspace
- Automatic virus scanning and format validation before processing
- Progress indicators during upload and embedding generation

### FR-2: Workspace-Scoped Organization

Documents must be organized within workspace boundaries with hierarchical structure:

- Workspace-level access control aligned with existing Compozy permissions
- Optional folder/tag organization for document discovery
- Search and filtering capabilities for document management
- Document metadata tracking (upload date, last modified, author, file type)

### FR-3: Automatic Embedding Generation

The system must automatically process uploaded documents into vector embeddings:

- Intelligent document chunking strategy optimized for retrieval quality
- Embedding generation using configurable models (OpenAI, Cohere, or local)
- Background job processing for large documents to avoid blocking uploads
- Re-embedding automation when documents are updated
- Embedding quality validation and error handling

### FR-4: Agent Query Interface

Agents must seamlessly access document knowledge through dual modes:

- **Automatic Mode:** Agent automatically searches relevant documents based on workflow context
- **Explicit Mode:** Agent can perform targeted document queries using natural language
- Context-aware retrieval prioritizing recently accessed and workflow-relevant documents
- Configurable context limits to manage token usage and response time

### FR-5: Document Versioning & Updates

The system must maintain document history and handle updates:

- Version tracking with timestamp and change attribution
- Automatic re-embedding when document content changes
- Option to reference specific document versions in workflows
- Clean-up policies for old versions to manage storage costs

### FR-6: Access Control & Security

Document access must align with workspace security requirements:

- Role-based access control (RBAC) at workspace level
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive documents
- Audit logging for document access and agent queries
- Data retention policies with automated deletion capabilities
- Integration with existing Compozy authentication systems

### FR-7: Search & Discovery Interface

Users must be able to manage their document collection:

- CLI commands: `compozy docs upload [file]`, `compozy docs list`, `compozy docs delete [id]`
- Full-text search across document content and metadata
- Document preview and access from CLI
- Bulk operations for document management
- Usage analytics showing which documents agents reference most

## User Experience

### Primary User Flow: Document Upload

1. User runs `compozy docs upload ./api-spec.md --tags "api,v2,public"`
2. System validates file format and size
3. Progress indicator shows upload and embedding generation status
4. Confirmation displays document ID, storage location, and access URL
5. Document immediately available for agent queries

### Agent Integration Experience

- **Seamless Context:** Agents automatically mention when referencing uploaded documents ("Based on your API documentation...")
- **Source Attribution:** Clear citations showing which documents influenced agent responses
- **Context Awareness:** Agents prioritize documents relevant to current workflow type
- **Feedback Loop:** Users can mark document references as helpful/unhelpful to improve future retrieval

### Error Handling & Recovery

- Upload failures provide specific error codes and resolution steps
- Document processing errors trigger email notifications with detailed logs
- Corrupted embeddings automatically trigger re-processing
- Clear messaging when documents exceed size or storage limits

### Accessibility Considerations

- CLI interface supports screen readers through proper status output
- Document metadata includes accessibility tags for assistive technologies
- Error messages follow accessibility guidelines for clear communication
- Future web interface will meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
