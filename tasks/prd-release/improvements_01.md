Recommendations

Enhance Idempotency:

Add gitRepo.HasStagedChanges() bool extension; check before commit.
Update PushBranch to support --force-with-lease (add bool param).
For release: Explicit TagExists check before create.

Handle Initial Version: In calculateVersion, if latestTag == "", use os.Getenv("INITIAL_VERSION") or config.
Extend PR Creation: Add assignees param to CreateOrUpdatePR (read from github.actor env).
Implement/Verify Release Orchestrator: Ensure it includes version extraction (regex on latest commit msg), tag idempotency, GoReleaser service (exec with envs/secrets), NPM publish, main changelog update.
Testing: Add unit tests for orchestrators (mock repos/services, like existing \_test.go files). E.g., TestPRReleaseOrchestrator_Execute_NoChanges.
Config/Env: Add ReleaseBranchPrefix to config.Config (hardcoded "release/" in code). Ensure all envs from README are bound (e.g., INITIAL_VERSION).
YAML Updates: Once added, simplify to: checkout/setups + go run ./pkg/release pr-release --ci-output --force=$INPUT, etc. Install gh CLI if needed for dry-run uploads/comments.

üö® CRITICAL ISSUES - Must Fix Before Using

1. Interface Contract Violations (Runtime Failures)


    - PushBranch method called (pr_release.go:109) but not in GitExtendedRepository interface
    - TagExists method called (release.go:184) but not in GitExtendedRepository interface
    - Fix: Add these methods to the interface and implement them in gitRepository

2. Missing Implementation


    - CreateOrUpdatePR not implemented in github_extended.go
    - Fix: Implement the actual GitHub API calls for PR creation/update

4. Missing Error Handling


    - exec.CommandContext for npm (pr_release.go:165) discards stdout/stderr
    - Fix: Capture and include output in errors for debugging

‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

1. GoReleaser Integration Incomplete


    - release.go:210-225 has just placeholder code
    - Fix: Either fully implement or document that GitHub Actions handles this separately

2. No Idempotency for PR Creation


    - PR creation doesn't check for existing PRs
    - Fix: Query GitHub for existing PRs before creating

3. Hard-coded Configuration


    - Tools directory hard-coded as "tools" (pr_release.go:172)
    - Fix: Accept from config and pass through orchestrator

4. Silent Failures


    - package-lock.json errors ignored (pr_release.go:207)
    - Fix: Handle file-not-found gracefully without aborting

üìä MEDIUM PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS

1. Missing Validations


    - No version format validation before operations
    - No branch name format validation
    - Fix: Add validation methods with proper regex patterns

2. No Retry Logic


    - Network operations lack retry for transient failures
    - Fix: Implement exponential backoff for GitHub/npm operations

3. Environment Variables


    - No validation of required env vars (GITHUB_TOKEN, etc.)
    - Fix: Check and fail early with clear error messages
