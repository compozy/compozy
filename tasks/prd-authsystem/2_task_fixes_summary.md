# Task 2.0 Security Fixes Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. GetAPIKeyByHash O(n) DoS Vulnerability ✅

**Problem**: Loading ALL API keys into memory for bcrypt comparison
**Solution**:

- Added `fingerprint` column with SHA-256 hash of plaintext key
- Created unique index for O(1) lookups
- Query by fingerprint first, then verify with bcrypt (defense in depth)
- Migration: `20250711173300_add_api_key_fingerprint.sql`

### 2. base62Encode Entropy Loss ✅

**Problem**: Only using 8 bytes of 32-byte entropy, losing ~120 bits
**Solution**:

- Replaced uint64-based encoding with math/big implementation
- Now preserves full 256-bit entropy
- Produces consistent 43-character base62 strings (48 chars with prefix)

### 3. Fire-and-Forget Context Issue ✅

**Problem**: Using request context in goroutine which may be cancelled
**Solution**:

- Changed to use `context.Background()` for fire-and-forget operations
- Ensures last_used update completes even if request is cancelled

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:

1. `engine/auth/uc/service.go`
   - Fixed base62Encode with math/big
   - Added fingerprint generation in generateAPIKey
   - Fixed context in fire-and-forget goroutine

2. `engine/auth/infra/postgres/repository.go`
   - Updated GetAPIKeyByHash to use fingerprint for O(1) lookup
   - Added fingerprint to all API key queries
   - Added SHA-256 import

3. `engine/auth/model/apikey.go`
   - Added Fingerprint field to APIKey struct

4. `engine/auth/uc/service_test.go`
   - Updated tests to handle new generateAPIKey signature
   - Added fingerprint validation

5. `engine/infra/store/migrations/20250711173300_add_api_key_fingerprint.sql`
   - Added fingerprint column with NOT NULL constraint
   - Created unique index for performance
   - Included migration for existing data

## Security Improvements

1. **Performance**: O(n) vulnerability eliminated - lookups now O(1)
2. **Entropy**: Full 256-bit entropy preserved in API keys
3. **Reliability**: Fire-and-forget operations complete reliably
4. **Defense in Depth**: Fingerprint + bcrypt verification provides double protection

## Verification

- All tests pass: ✅
- Linting clean: ✅
- Migration applied successfully: ✅
- No workarounds used - proper solutions implemented following project standards
