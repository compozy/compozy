# Task 5.0 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated the MonitoringService into the main application server and Temporal workers with proper dependency injection and endpoint registration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Project Configuration Updates

- Added `MonitoringConfig` field to `project.Config` struct
- Added monitoring import and validation in project config
- Set default monitoring config during project load

### 2. Server Integration

- Added `monitoring` field to Server struct
- Initialize MonitoringService in `setupDependencies()` with proper error handling
- Added monitoring middleware BEFORE other middleware in `buildRouter()`
- Registered `/metrics` endpoint on main Gin router (not versioned under /api/v0/)
- Added graceful shutdown for monitoring service

### 3. Worker Integration

- Added `MonitoringService` field to worker Config struct
- Updated `NewWorker` to accept monitoring service
- Created `buildWorkerOptions()` helper function to configure worker with monitoring interceptor
- Updated worker client to accept worker options pointer

### 4. Error Handling

- Monitoring initialization failures are logged but don't fail server startup
- Server continues with nil monitoring service if initialization fails
- All monitoring service calls are protected with nil checks

### 5. Swagger Documentation

- Created `metrics_handler.go` with Swagger annotations for /metrics endpoint
- Added "Operations" tag to main.go for operational endpoints
- Documented endpoint purpose, response format, and available metrics

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Graceful Degradation**: If monitoring fails to initialize, the server continues to operate normally without metrics
2. **Middleware Order**: Monitoring middleware is added BEFORE other middleware to ensure all requests are tracked
3. **Endpoint Path**: /metrics is not versioned (not under /api/v0/) as it's an operational endpoint
4. **Configuration**: Monitoring config is part of project config (compozy.yaml) with environment variable override support

## Testing

- All existing tests pass
- Linting issues resolved
- Code follows project standards for error handling and logging

## Success Criteria Met

✅ MonitoringService properly integrated into main server startup
✅ /metrics endpoint correctly registered and serving Prometheus format
✅ Gin middleware applied to all HTTP routes before other middleware
✅ Temporal interceptor integrated with worker initialization
✅ Graceful shutdown handled properly
✅ Server starts successfully with monitoring enabled and disabled modes
✅ All integration tests passing
✅ Swagger documentation added for /metrics endpoint
