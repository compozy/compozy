# Task 7.0: Testing and Validation

## Overview

Comprehensive testing of the new runtime system including unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks, and validation of all example projects.

## Subtasks

- [ ] 7.1 Write unit tests for all new components
- [ ] 7.2 Create integration tests for runtime scenarios
- [ ] 7.3 Implement performance benchmarks for Bun runtime
- [ ] 7.4 Validate all example projects work with new runtime
- [ ] 7.5 Test entrypoint generator functionality
- [ ] 7.6 Create end-to-end tests for complex workflows
- [ ] 7.7 Make sure 70% of the code is covered by tests

## Implementation Details

### Unit Test Coverage

- Runtime interface implementations
- Factory pattern functionality
- Entrypoint generator logic
- Configuration validation
- Error handling paths

### Integration Test Scenarios

- Tool execution with various input/output types
- Timeout handling and cancellation
- Environment variable propagation
- Process lifecycle management
- Error recovery and cleanup

### Performance Testing

```go
func BenchmarkBunRuntime(b *testing.B) {
    // Measure execution times
    // Measure startup overhead
    // Test concurrent executions
    // Validate performance targets
}
```

### Example Project Validation

- Weather example with multiple tools
- Nested task workflows
- Memory system integration
- Signal handling scenarios
- Schedule execution

## Success Criteria

- Test coverage exceeds 80% for new code
- All example projects pass with new runtime
- Performance benchmarks establish baseline metrics
- Entrypoint generator tested with various configurations
- No regression in existing functionality
- Edge cases and error scenarios covered

<critical>
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
    - Architecture patterns: `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`
    - Go coding standards: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc`
    - Testing requirements: `.cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc`
    - API standards: `.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc`
    - Security & quality: `.cursor/rules/quality-security.mdc`
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test` before completing parent tasks
- **MUST** follow `.cursor/rules/task-review.mdc` workflow for parent tasks

**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
