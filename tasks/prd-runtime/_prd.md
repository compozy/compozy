# Product Requirements Document: Runtime System Refactoring

## Overview

Refactor Compozy's runtime system to transition from Deno to Bun, introducing a flexible architecture that supports multiple JavaScript runtimes while simplifying tool configuration and execution.

## Problem Statement

The current runtime system has several limitations:

- Single runtime option without flexibility for alternatives
- Complex configuration requiring both `execute` property and importMap entries
- Dependency on deno.json and importMap for tool resolution
- Redundant configuration patterns that increase maintenance burden

## Goals

1. **Runtime Flexibility**: Enable support for multiple JavaScript runtimes (Bun, Node.js)
2. **Simplified Configuration**: Eliminate redundant tool configuration requirements
3. **Improved Performance**: Leverage Bun's faster startup and execution times
4. **Future-Proof Architecture**: Create extensible system for future runtime additions

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Entrypoint-Based Tool Resolution**

    - Replace importMap/deno.json with a single TypeScript entrypoint file
    - Tools exported as named exports matching their tool IDs
    - Support for both file-based and inline tool definitions

2. **Multi-Runtime Support**

    - Primary support for Bun runtime
    - Secondary support for Node.js runtime
    - Runtime selection via configuration

3. **Clean Architecture**

    - Greenfield implementation without legacy constraints
    - Direct replacement of existing runtime system
    - No backwards compatibility requirements per development policy

4. **Tool Configuration Simplification**
    - Remove `execute` property from tool configuration
    - Automatic tool resolution via entrypoint exports

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: 20% improvement in tool execution time
2. **Reliability**: Maintain existing error handling and recovery
3. **Developer Experience**: Simplified configuration and clear documentation
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all runtime implementations

## Success Criteria

1. All examples updated to use new runtime system
2. Measurable performance improvement in tool execution (20%+)
3. Simplified configuration with entrypoint pattern
4. Support for both Bun and Node.js runtimes
5. Complete removal of Deno dependencies

## Timeline

4-week implementation timeline with direct replacement approach.
