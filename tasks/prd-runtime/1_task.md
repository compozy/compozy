# Task 1.0: Create Runtime Interface and Factory Pattern

## Overview

Define the runtime interface that the existing Manager will implement, and create a factory pattern following project conventions for runtime selection. This establishes the foundation for supporting multiple JavaScript runtimes.

## Subtasks

- [x] 1.1 Create `engine/runtime/interface.go` with Runtime interface that Manager will implement ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] 1.2 Create `engine/runtime/factory.go` following the project's factory pattern (like llmadapter) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] 1.3 Ensure existing Manager struct implements the Runtime interface ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] 1.4 Create runtime type constants (bun, node) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] 1.5 Write comprehensive tests for factory and interface compliance ✅ COMPLETED

## Implementation Details

### Runtime Interface (from tech spec)

```go
// Runtime interface that existing Manager will implement
type Runtime interface {
    ExecuteTool(ctx context.Context, toolID string, toolExecID core.ID, input *core.Input, env core.EnvMap) (*core.Output, error)
    ExecuteToolWithTimeout(ctx context.Context, toolID string, toolExecID core.ID, input *core.Input, env core.EnvMap, timeout time.Duration) (*core.Output, error)
    GetGlobalTimeout() time.Duration
}

// Factory following project patterns (like llmadapter.Factory)
type Factory interface {
    CreateRuntime(ctx context.Context, config *Config) (Runtime, error)
}
```

### Key Considerations

- Interface must be compatible with existing Manager methods
- Error handling should maintain current patterns
- Factory pattern enables runtime selection based on configuration

## Success Criteria

- Runtime interface covers all existing functionality
- Factory pattern supports runtime selection
- Interfaces are well-documented with godoc comments
- Tests demonstrate interface usage patterns
- No breaking changes to existing runtime usage

<critical>
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
    - Architecture patterns: `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`
    - Go coding standards: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc`
    - Testing requirements: `.cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc`
    - API standards: `.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc`
    - Security & quality: `.cursor/rules/quality-security.mdc`
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test` before completing parent tasks
- **MUST** follow `.cursor/rules/task-review.mdc` workflow for parent tasks

**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
