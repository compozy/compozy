## Implementation Details

### Performance Optimization

Optimize data handling for large workflow and execution collections, implement efficient pagination, and optimize TUI rendering for smooth interactions.

### Caching Implementation

Add intelligent caching for frequently accessed data like workflow lists, configuration data, and server information.

### Progress Indicators

Implement progress indicators for operations like project initialization, large data fetches, and file operations.

### Documentation Creation

Create comprehensive CLI documentation with usage examples, best practices, and troubleshooting guides.

### Quality Assurance

Perform final testing across all functionality, fix discovered bugs, and ensure overall system stability and reliability.

### Relevant Files

- `cli/cache/` - Caching implementation
- `cli/performance/` - Performance optimization utilities
- `cli/progress/` - Progress indicator components
