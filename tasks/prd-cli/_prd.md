# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances Compozy's CLI interface from a basic development server command to a comprehensive workflow orchestration tool with modern Terminal User Interface (TUI) capabilities. The CLI will provide complete API coverage with beautiful, interactive interfaces while maintaining perfect compatibility for automation and scripting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize new Compozy projects interactively, so that I can quickly set up projects with proper structure and configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `compozy init` THEN the system SHALL present an interactive form for project setup
2. WHEN I provide a project name THEN the system SHALL create a directory structure with `compozy.yaml`, workflows/, tools/, and agents/ directories
3. WHEN I select a template THEN the system SHALL initialize the project with template-specific configurations
4. IF I specify `--template` flag THEN the system SHALL use the specified template without interactive prompts
5. WHEN initialization completes THEN the system SHALL display a styled success message with next steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want to list and manage workflows through a beautiful CLI interface, so that I can efficiently discover and work with available workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `compozy workflow list` THEN the system SHALL display workflows in a styled table format
2. WHEN I specify `--format json` THEN the system SHALL output machine-readable JSON for automation
3. WHEN I run `compozy workflow get <id>` THEN the system SHALL show detailed workflow information with components
4. WHEN I use `--show-tasks` flag THEN the system SHALL include task details in the output
5. WHEN workflows are not found THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with suggestions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a workflow operator, I want to execute workflows with real-time progress monitoring, so that I can track execution status and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `compozy workflow execute <id>` THEN the system SHALL start workflow execution and return execution ID
2. WHEN I use `--follow` flag THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress with logs in a TUI interface
3. WHEN I provide `--input` or `--input-file` THEN the system SHALL pass the data to the workflow execution
4. WHEN execution completes THEN the system SHALL display final status and results
5. WHEN execution fails THEN the system SHALL show error details with troubleshooting suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow monitor, I want to view and manage workflow executions, so that I can track system activity and control running workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `compozy execution list` THEN the system SHALL display executions in a filterable table
2. WHEN I use `--workflow <id>` filter THEN the system SHALL show only executions for that workflow
3. WHEN I use `--status <status>` filter THEN the system SHALL show only executions with matching status
4. WHEN I run `compozy execution get <exec-id>` THEN the system SHALL show detailed execution information
5. WHEN I use `--show-logs` flag THEN the system SHALL include execution logs in the output

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage workflow schedules through the CLI, so that I can configure automated workflow execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `compozy schedule list` THEN the system SHALL display all scheduled workflows with their CRON expressions
2. WHEN I run `compozy schedule update <workflow-id> --cron <expression>` THEN the system SHALL update the workflow schedule
3. WHEN I use `--enabled true/false` THEN the system SHALL enable or disable the schedule
4. WHEN I run `compozy schedule delete <workflow-id>` THEN the system SHALL remove the workflow schedule
5. WHEN schedule operations fail THEN the system SHALL display validation errors with CRON expression help

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an integration developer, I want to send events and signals through the CLI, so that I can trigger workflows and control execution flow programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `compozy event send <event-name>` THEN the system SHALL send the event to trigger workflows
2. WHEN I provide `--payload` or `--payload-file` THEN the system SHALL include the data with the event
3. WHEN I run `compozy execution signal <exec-id> <signal-name>` THEN the system SHALL send the signal to the running execution
4. WHEN signal operations succeed THEN the system SHALL confirm signal delivery
5. WHEN target execution is not found THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want beautiful, consistent CLI output with modern TUI features, so that I have an excellent developer experience while maintaining automation compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run any command in a terminal THEN the system SHALL display styled output with colors and formatting
2. WHEN output is piped or redirected THEN the system SHALL automatically disable TUI features and use plain text
3. WHEN I specify `--format json` THEN the system SHALL output machine-readable JSON regardless of terminal type
4. WHEN I use `--no-color` or set NO_COLOR environment variable THEN the system SHALL disable all color output
5. WHEN I use `--interactive` flag THEN the system SHALL force interactive TUI mode even in non-terminal environments

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive configuration management, so that I can validate and troubleshoot CLI setup issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `compozy config validate` THEN the system SHALL check configuration file syntax and required fields
2. WHEN I run `compozy config show` THEN the system SHALL display current configuration with sources (file, env, defaults)
3. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL display styled error messages with specific line numbers and suggestions
4. WHEN I use `--include-defaults` THEN the system SHALL show all configuration values including defaults
5. WHEN configuration files are missing THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance for setup

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a CLI user, I want consistent global options and help, so that I can efficiently use the tool across all commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `--server-url` THEN all client commands SHALL connect to the specified Compozy server
2. WHEN I use `--config` THEN the system SHALL load configuration from the specified file
3. WHEN I use `--help` on any command THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive help with examples
4. WHEN I use `--debug` THEN the system SHALL enable verbose logging for troubleshooting
5. WHEN I use global flags THEN they SHALL be available and consistent across all commands

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As an automation engineer, I want perfect JSON output and scriptability, so that I can integrate CLI commands into CI/CD pipelines and scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify `--format json` THEN the system SHALL output valid JSON that can be parsed by tools like jq
2. WHEN commands are used in scripts THEN the system SHALL automatically disable interactive features
3. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate exit codes for script error handling
4. WHEN I use `--quiet` flag THEN the system SHALL suppress non-essential output for clean automation
5. WHEN JSON output is requested THEN the system SHALL never include ANSI color codes or TUI elements
