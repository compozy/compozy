# Task 19.0: Comprehensive Testing

## Overview

Create unit tests for all command logic and API client methods, build integration tests for complete command execution flows, implement mock API client leveraging interface segregation for easier testing, add TUI component tests for user interaction scenarios, and write JSON output validation tests for automation compatibility.

<import>**MUST READ BEFORE STARTING** @.cursor/rules/critical-validation.mdc</import>

<requirements>
- **REUSE**: Apply stretchr/testify patterns (already in project) for assertions and mocks
- **REUSE**: Use existing test/helpers patterns for test environment setup
- **REUSE**: Follow existing testing patterns from cli/auth/*_test.go files
- **LIBRARY**: Use stretchr/testify/mock for API client mocking
- **ENHANCED**: Leverage interface segregation from Task 4 for easier, more focused mocking
- **ENHANCED**: Create separate mocks for read-only vs mutate operations
- **LIBRARY**: Use charmbracelet/x/exp/teatest for TUI component testing
- **LIBRARY**: Use tidwall/gjson for JSON output validation in tests
- **REUSE**: Apply test/fixtures patterns for test data management
- **REUSE**: Use logger.FromContext(ctx) consistently in test setup
- Requirements: All requirements validation

## Subtasks

- [ ] 18.1 Create unit tests for all command logic and API clients with segregated mocking
- [ ] 18.2 Build integration tests for complete command flows
- [ ] 18.3 Implement segregated mock API clients for isolated testing
- [ ] 18.4 Add TUI component tests and interaction scenarios
- [ ] 18.5 Write JSON output validation and automation tests

## Implementation Details

### Unit Testing with Segregated Mocking

Create comprehensive unit tests for all command logic, API client methods, validation functions, and utility components. Leverage interface segregation from Task 4 to create focused mocks for read-only operations (WorkflowReader) and mutate operations (WorkflowExecutor), making tests more maintainable and reliable.

### Integration Testing

Build end-to-end integration tests that verify complete command execution flows in both TUI and JSON modes.

### Segregated Mock Implementation

Implement MockAPIClient following the segregated interface strategy from the techspec, providing separate mock implementations for read and mutate operations. This enables more precise test control and easier verification of specific operation types.

### TUI Testing

Create tests for TUI components that verify user interactions, state management, and display logic.

### JSON Validation

Write tests that validate JSON output structure, content, and automation compatibility across all commands.

### Relevant Files

- `cli/commands/*_test.go` - Unit tests for all commands
- `cli/services/*_test.go` - Unit tests for all services
- `cli/mocks/readers.go` - Mock implementations for read-only operations
- `cli/mocks/writers.go` - Mock implementations for mutate operations
- `cli/integration_test.go` - Integration test suite
- `cli/tui/components/*_test.go` - TUI component tests

### Dependent Files

- All implementation files from previous tasks
- `test/helpers/` - Existing test utilities
- `pkg/logger/` - Logging for test debugging

## Success Criteria

- Unit tests cover all command logic and API client functionality with segregated mocking
- Interface segregation enables focused, maintainable test mocks for different operation types
- Integration tests verify complete command execution flows
- Segregated mock API clients enable precise testing without server dependencies
- TUI component tests validate user interaction scenarios
- JSON output tests ensure automation compatibility and structure validation
