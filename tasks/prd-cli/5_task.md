# Task 5.0: Execution Monitoring Features

## Overview

Build comprehensive execution monitoring capabilities including status tracking, progress visualization, execution history, and performance metrics to give developers complete visibility into workflow operations.

## Subtasks

- [ ] 5.1 Build `run status` command with detailed execution view
- [ ] 5.2 Implement wait flags with configurable timeouts
- [ ] 5.3 Create progress indicators for long-running workflows
- [ ] 5.4 Add execution history with filtering and search
- [ ] 5.5 Build performance metrics display with styled output

## Implementation Details

### Status Command (TUI)

```go
// Beautiful real-time status display
╭─ Execution: exec-abc123 ─────────────────╮
│ Workflow:   customer-support             │
│ Status:     ⠙ Running                    │
│ Progress:   ████████░░░░ 67%             │
│ Duration:   2m 34s                       │
│                                          │
│ Tasks:                                   │
│   ✓ Initialize     (0.5s)                │
│   ✓ Load Data      (1.2s)                │
│   ⠙ Process        (45s...)              │
│   ○ Finalize       (pending)             │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

### Progress Visualization

- Task-level progress bars
- Overall workflow completion percentage
- ETA calculation based on historical data
- Real-time updates without flickering

### Performance Metrics

- Execution duration (per task and total)
- Resource consumption (if available)
- Success/failure rates
- Comparison with previous runs

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Status command provides comprehensive execution details
- [ ] Progress indicators accurately reflect workflow state
- [ ] Wait functionality respects timeouts and exit codes
- [ ] History search is fast and flexible
- [ ] Metrics help identify performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Alerts trigger reliably for configured conditions
- [ ] Monitoring doesn't impact workflow performance

<critical>
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

- **ALWAYS** verify against PRD and tech specs - NEVER make assumptions
- **NEVER** use workarounds, especially in tests - implement proper solutions
- **MUST** follow all established project standards:
  - Architecture patterns: `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`
  - Go coding standards: `.cursor/rules/go-coding-standards.mdc`
  - Testing requirements: `.cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc`
  - API standards: `.cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc`
  - Security & quality: `.cursor/rules/quality-security.mdc`
- **MUST** run `make lint` and `make test` before completing parent tasks
- **MUST** follow `.cursor/rules/task-review.mdc` workflow for parent tasks

**Enforcement:** Violating these standards results in immediate task rejection.
