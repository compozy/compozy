# Compozy CLI Implementation Task Summary

## Relevant Files

### Core Implementation Files

- `cli/root.go` - Root command structure to extend
- `cli/cmd/workflow/*.go` - Workflow management commands (new)
- `cli/cmd/run/*.go` - Execution management commands (new)
- `cli/shared/output.go` - Output manager with TUI/non-TUI modes (new)
- `cli/shared/styles.go` - Lipgloss styling system (new)
- `cli/shared/client.go` - API client for server communication (new)
- `cli/internal/tui/*.go` - TUI components with Bubble Tea (new)

### Integration Points

- `engine/infra/server/config/resolver.go` - Config resolution patterns
- `pkg/utils/cli.go` - CLI utilities for project detection
- `pkg/logger/mod.go` - Logging infrastructure
- `engine/core/errors.go` - Error handling patterns

### Documentation Files

- `docs/cli/README.md` - CLI user documentation
- `docs/cli/commands/*.md` - Individual command documentation

### Tests

- `cli/**/*_test.go` - Unit tests for CLI components
- `test/integration/cli/*.go` - Integration tests

## Task Complexity Analysis

- **Total Parent Tasks**: 7
- **Total Subtasks**: 30
- **High Complexity**: 1 task (Advanced TUI)
- **Medium Complexity**: 5 tasks
- **Low Complexity**: 1 task

## Implementation Order

1. **Foundation Phase** (Tasks 1-2): Core infrastructure and project setup
2. **Core Commands** (Tasks 3-4): Workflow and execution management
3. **Enhancement Phase** (Tasks 5-6): Monitoring and CI/CD support
4. **Polish Phase** (Task 7): Advanced TUI and optimizations

## Key Design Decisions

- **TUI by Default**: All commands use interactive TUI unless `--no-tui` flag is set
- **Singular Commands**: `compozy workflow` not `workflows`
- **Simplified Scope**: No log streaming, schedule, event, or config commands for MVP
- **Charmbracelet Stack**: Lipgloss for styling, Bubble Tea for interactivity, Huh for forms

## Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the implementation files
- Use `go test ./...` to run all tests
- Always run `make fmt && make lint && make test` before committing changes
- Follow project testing standards with `t.Run("Should...")` pattern
- TUI components should gracefully degrade in non-interactive environments
