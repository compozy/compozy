title: The OS Release
type: breaking
---

CompozyOS v0.3 is a new operating system boundary for agent work. Sessions, tasks, loops, memory,
permissions, automation, the OS shell, and Compozy Network now share one daemon-owned state model.
People can start and inspect that work from the web, CLI, HTTP/SSE, or UDS. Agents can operate the
same runtime through structured tools and extension contracts.

This is a breaking beta. The command, package, environment, storage, API, and tool namespaces move
to CompozyOS, and several v0.2 surfaces have deliberate replacements or removals. Follow the
[v0.3 migration guide](https://compozy.com/runtime/migration/) before replacing an existing install.
The maintained v0.2 line and its collateral remain on `legacy/v0.2`.

Install the beta through the verified hosted installer, `@compozy/cli@beta`, or the explicit
`github.com/compozy/compozy@v0.3.0-beta.1` Go version. The beta channel may change before v0.3.0
stable; production rollouts should pin the version and review each prerelease.

The repository was already MIT licensed. v0.3 corrects stale BSL-1.1 text in distribution metadata;
it does not relicense the code.
