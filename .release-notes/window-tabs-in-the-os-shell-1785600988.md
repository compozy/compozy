title: Window tabs in the OS shell
type: feature
---

The OS shell now groups windows into first-class tab frames instead of assuming one window per app. Tabs carry ordered members, an active member, per-tab navigation stacks, pinning, scoped close and reopen, and bounded history. The same topology is exposed through Web, CLI, HTTP, UDS, native tools, streams, hooks, resources, layout profiles, and the bundled Compozy skill, so agents operate windows with the same semantics people see. (#287)

- Run multiple instances of the same app, discover their tabs from the dock and the command palette, and drag to group, reorder, or tear out a tab.
- Move, swap, and zoom by frame instead of by single window, and adjust Window Manager behavior directly from Settings.
- `compozy config set window_manager.*` applies through the canonical Settings section endpoint, so a live apply projects only that section and unrelated restart-required drift stays pending and truthful in `compozy status`.

Migration notes: persisted window layouts move to v3 as a hard cut — v2 layout compatibility paths and singleton-window assumptions were removed from the runtime, generated contracts, and layout profiles.
